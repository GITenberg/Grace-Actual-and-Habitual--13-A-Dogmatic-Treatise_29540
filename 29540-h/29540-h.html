<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Humanity was reconciled to God by the Redemption.
This does not, however, mean that
every individual human being was forthwith justified,
for individual justification is wrought by
the application to the soul of grace derived from
the inexhaustible merits of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are two kinds of grace: (1) actual and
(2) habitual. Actual grace is a supernatural
gift by which rational creatures are enabled to
perform salutary acts. Habitual, or, as it is commonly
called, sanctifying, grace is a habit, or
more or less enduring state, which renders men
pleasing to God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This distinction is of comparatively recent date,
but it furnishes an excellent principle of division
for a dogmatic treatise on grace.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">General Notion of Grace.</span></span>—The best way
to arrive at a correct definition of actual grace is
by the synthetic method. We therefore begin
with the general notion of grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like <span class="tei tei-q">“nature,”</span><a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> grace
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia</span></span>, χάρις) is a word
of wide reach, used in a great variety of senses.
Habert<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> enumerates no less than fourteen;
which, however, may be reduced to four.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Subjectively, grace signifies good will or
benevolence shown by a superior to an inferior, as
when a criminal is pardoned by the king's grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Objectively, it designates a favor inspired
by good will or benevolence. In this sense the
term may be applied to any free and gratuitous
gift (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">donum gratis datum</span></span>),
as when a king bestows graces on his lieges.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Grace may also mean personal charm or attractiveness.
In this sense the term frequently
occurs in Latin and Greek literature (the Three
Graces). Charm elicits love and prompts a person
to the bestowal of favors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
d) The recipient of gifts or favors usually
feels gratitude towards the giver, which he expresses
in the form of thanks. Hence the word
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratiae</span></span>
(plural) frequently stands for thanksgiving
(<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratias agere</span></span>,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deo gratias</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“to say
grace after meals”</span>).<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first and fundamental of these meanings
is <span class="tei tei-q">“a free gift or favor.”</span> The benevolence of
the giver and the attractiveness of the recipient
are merely the reasons for which the gift is imparted,
whereas the expression of thanks is an
effect following its bestowal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dogmatic theology is concerned exclusively
with grace in the fundamental sense of the term.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
e) Grace is called a gift (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">donum</span></span>, δωρεά),
because it is owing to free benevolence, not required by justice. It is
called gratuitous (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratis datum</span></span>),
because it is bestowed
without any corresponding merit on the part of the creature.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
A gift may be due to the recipient as a matter of
distributive or commutative justice, and in that case it
would not be absolutely gratuitous (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratis</span></span>).
Grace, on the contrary, is bestowed out of pure benevolence, from no
other motive than sheer love. This is manifestly St.
Paul's idea when he writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“And if by grace, it is not
now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace.”</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> It is
likewise the meaning of St. Augustine when he says, in his
Homilies on the Gospel of St. John, that grace is <span class="tei tei-q">“something
gratuitously given ... as a present, not in return
for something else.”</span><a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Natural and Supernatural Grace.</span></span>—Grace
is not necessarily supernatural. Sacred
Scripture and the Fathers sometimes apply the
word to purely natural gifts. We petition God
for our daily bread, for good health, fair weather
and other temporal favors, and we thank Him
for preserving us from pestilence, famine, and
war, although these are blessings which do not
transcend the order of nature.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Our petitions for purely natural favors are inspired
by the conviction that creation itself, and everything connected
therewith, is a gratuitous gift of God. This conviction
is well founded. God was under no necessity of
creating anything: creation was an act of His free-will.
Again, many of the favors to which human nature, as
such, has a claim, are free gifts when conferred upon the
individual. Good health, fortitude, talent, etc., are natural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
graces, for which we are allowed, nay obliged, to petition
God. The Pelagians employed this truth to conceal a pernicious
error when they unctuously descanted on the
magnitude and necessity of grace as manifested in creation.
It was by such trickery that their leader succeeded in
persuading the bishops assembled at the Council of Diospolis
or Lydda (A. D. 415) that his teaching was quite orthodox.
St. Augustine and four other African bishops
later reported to Pope Innocent I, that if these prelates
had perceived that Pelagius meant to deny that grace by
which we are Christians and sons of God, they would not
have listened to him so patiently, and that, consequently,
no blame attached to these judges because they simply
took the term <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> in its ecclesiastical
sense.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Generally speaking, however, the term
<span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> is reserved for what are commonly
called the supernatural gifts of God, the merely
preternatural as well as the strictly supernatural.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>
In this sense "grace" is as sharply opposed to
purely natural favors as nature is opposed to the
supernatural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The importance of the distinction between supernatural
and purely natural grace will appear from an analysis of
the concept itself. Considered as gifts of God, the strictly
supernatural graces (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, justification, divine sonship, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
beatific vision) ontologically exceed the bounds of nature.
Considered as purely gratuitous favors, they are negatively
and positively undeserved. The grace involved in creation,
for instance, is not conferred on some existing beneficiary,
but actually produces its recipient. The creation
itself, therefore, being entirely <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratis data</span></span>,
all that succeeds it, supernatural grace included, must be negatively
undeserved, in as far as it was not necessary for the recipient
to exist at all. But the supernatural graces are
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">indebitae</span></span>
also positively, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> positing the creation, because
they transcend every creatural claim and power. Both
elements are contained in the above-quoted letter of the
African bishops to Pope Innocent I: <span class="tei tei-q">“Though it may be
said in a certain legitimate sense, that we were created by
the grace of God, ... that is a different grace by which
we are called predestined, by which we are justified, and
by which we receive eternal beatitude.”</span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> Of this last-mentioned
grace (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> grace in the strictly supernatural
sense), St. Augustine says: <span class="tei tei-q">“This, the grace which Catholic
bishops are wont to read in the books of God and
preach to their people, and the grace which the Apostle
commends, is not that by which we are created as men, but
that by which as sinful men we are
justified.”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> In other
words, natural is opposed to supernatural grace in the
same way that nature is opposed to the supernatural.
<span class="tei tei-q">“[To believe] is the work of grace, not of nature. It is, I
say, the work of grace, which the second Adam brought us,
not of nature, which Adam wholly lost in himself.”</span><a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Adding the new note obtained by this analysis we arrive at
the following definition: Grace is a gratuitous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">super-natural</span></em>
gift.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Grace of God and the Grace of
Christ.</span></span>—Though all supernatural graces are
from God, a distinction is made between the
<span class="tei tei-q">“grace of God”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“grace of Christ.”</span> The
difference between them is purely accidental,
based on the fact that the <span class="tei tei-q">“grace of Christ”</span> flows
exclusively from the merits of the atonement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The following points may serve as criteria to distinguish
the two notions:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A) The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Dei</span></span>
springs from divine benevolence and
presupposes a recipient who is unworthy merely in a negative
sense (=not worthy, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non dignus</span></span>),
whereas the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
Christi</span></span> flows from mercy and benevolence and is conferred
on a recipient who is positively unworthy
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">indignus</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
B) The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Dei</span></span>
elevates the soul to the supernatural order
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia elevans</span></span>), while the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Christi</span></span> heals the
wounds inflicted by sin, especially concupiscence
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
elevans simul et sanans</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
C) The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Dei</span></span> is a gratuitous gift
conferred by the Blessed Trinity without regard to the theandric merits of
Jesus Christ, whereas the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Christi</span></span> is
based entirely on those merits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The Scotists hold that the distinction between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
Dei</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Christi</span></span> is purely
logical. They regard
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the God-man as the predestined centre of the universe
and the source of all graces.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> The Thomists, on the
other hand, regard the grace of the angels, and that
wherewith our first parents were endowed in Paradise,
purely as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Dei</span></span>;
they hold that the merits of Christ
did not become operative until after the Fall, and that,
consequently, there is a real distinction between the grace
of the angels and that of our first parents on the one
hand, and the grace of Christ on the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As it cannot reasonably be supposed that the angels
are endowed with specifically the same graces by which
mankind was redeemed from sin, the Scotists are forced
to admit a distinction between the grace of Christ as God-man
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Christi Dei-hominis</span></span>)
and the grace of Christ as Redeemer
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia Christi Redemptoris</span></span>), so that even
according to them, the dogmatic treatise on Grace is concerned
solely with the grace of Christ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qua</span></span> Redeemer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, grace must be more particularly defined as a gratuitous
supernatural gift <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">derived from the merits of Jesus
Christ</span></em>.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">External and Internal Grace.</span></span>—External
grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia externa</span></span>) comprises all those
strictly supernatural institutions which stimulate
pious thoughts and salutary resolutions in the
human soul. Such are, for example, Holy Scripture,
the Church, the Sacraments, the example of Jesus Christ, etc.
Internal grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia interna</span></span>)
inheres or operates invisibly in the soul,
and places it in relation with God as its supernatural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
end. Internal graces are, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, the theological
virtues, the power of forgiving sins, etc. The
Pelagians admitted external, but obstinately denied
internal grace.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Paul<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> emphasizes the distinction between external
and internal grace by designating the former as <span class="tei tei-q">“law”</span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lex</span></span>, νόμος)
and the latter as <span class="tei tei-q">“faith”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides</span></span>, πίστις).
With one exception, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, the Hypostatic Union, which
is the climax of all graces), external is inferior to,
because a mere preparation for, internal grace, which
aims at sanctification. We are concerned in this treatise
solely with internal grace. Hence, proceeding a step
further, we may define grace as a gratuitous, supernatural,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> gift of God, derived from the merits of Jesus
Christ.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>

Christ, existing invisibly in the soul either as a transient impulse

(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus</span></span>), tends either to the salvation of the
person in whom it inheres or through him to
the sanctification of others. In the former case it is called ingratiating
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia gratum faciens</span></span>),

Each of these two species of internal grace may exist
independently of the other because personal holiness is
not a necessary prerequisite for the exercise of the charismata

is decidedly superior to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia

admonishes the Corinthians: <span class="tei tei-q">“Be zealous for the

since the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia gratis data</span></span> is treated
elsewhere (Apologetics,
Mystic and Sacramental Theology), we must add another
note to our definition: Grace is a gratuitous, supernatural,
internal gift, derived from the merits of Jesus
Christ, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by which man is rendered pleasing in the sight of
God</span></em>.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>

6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Actual and Habitual Grace.</span></span>—The
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
gratum faciens</span></span> is given either for the performance
of a supernatural act or for the production
of a permanent supernatural state (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus</span></span>).
In the latter case it is called habitual, or, as it sanctifies
the creature in the eyes of God, sanctifying
grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Actual grace comprises two essential elements: (1)
divine help as the principle of every salutary supernatural
act, and (2) the salutary act itself. Hence its designation
by the Fathers as Θεοῦ ἐνέργεια, ἡ τοῦ Λόγου χείρ, θεία κίνησις,
or, in Latin, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Dei auxilium, subsidium, adiutorium, motio
divina</span></span>,—all of which appellations have been adopted by
the Schoolmen. Actual grace invariably tends either to
produce habitual or sanctifying grace, or to preserve and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
increase it where it already exists. It follows that, being
merely a means to an end, actual grace is inferior to
sanctifying grace, which is that end itself.
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Actual grace may therefore be defined as an
unmerited, supernatural, internal divine help,
based on the merits of Jesus Christ, which renders
man pleasing in the sight of God, enabling
him to perform salutary acts; or, somewhat
more succinctly, as a supernatural help bestowed
for the performance of salutary acts, in consideration
of the merits of Jesus Christ.
</span></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Actual grace is (1) a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">help</span></em>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">auxilium</span></span>), because it
consists in a transient influence exercised by God on
the soul. (2) A <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supernatural</span></em> help, to distinguish it from
God's ordinary providence and all such merely natural

Jesus Christ, in order to indicate that the graces granted
to fallen man are all derived from the atonement both
as their efficient and their meritorious cause. (4) Actual
grace is said to be given for the performance of
salutary acts to show that its immediate purpose or end is
an act, not a state, and that the acts for which it is given
must be in the order of salvation.

7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Twofold Causality of Actual
Grace.</span></span>—If grace is a supernatural help, mere
nature cannot, of its own strength, perform salutary
acts. Consequently, actual grace exercises a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
causal influence without which man would be helpless
in the matter of salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The causality of actual grace is both moral and
physical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) As a moral cause grace removes the obstacles
which render the work of salvation
difficult. Besides this negative it also has a positive
effect: it inspires delight in virtue and hatred
of sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This mode of operation manifestly presupposes a certain
weakness of the human will, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concupiscence</span></em>,
which is an effect of original sin. Actual grace exercises
a healing influence on the will<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> and is therefore called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sanans sive medicinalis</span></span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unless something is put before the soul to please and attract it,”</span> says St.
Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“the will can in no wise be moved; but it is not
in man's power to bring this about.”</span><a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> Concretely, this
moral causality of grace manifests itself as a divinely inspired
joy in virtue and a hatred of sin, both of which
incline the will to the free performance of salutary acts.
These sentiments may in some cases be so strong
as to deprive the will temporarily of its freedom
to resist. The sudden conversion of St. Paul is a
case in point. Holy Scripture expressly assures us that
God is the absolute master of the human will and, if He
so chooses, can bend it under His yoke without using
physical force. Cfr. Prov. XXI, 1: <span class="tei tei-q">“The heart of the
king is in the hand of the Lord: whithersoever he will,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he shall turn it.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Who will be so foolish as to say,”</span>
queries St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“that God cannot change the evil
wills of men, whichever, whenever, and wheresoever He
chooses, and direct them to what is
good?”</span><a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> It is but
rarely, of course, that God grants to any man a summary
victory over his sinful nature; but this fact does not prevent
the Church from praying: <span class="tei tei-q">“Vouchsafe, O Lord, to
compel our wills to thee, even though they be
rebellious.”</span><a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Even more important than the moral
causality of grace is its physical causality. Man
depends entirely on God for the physical strength
necessary to perform salutary works. Grace elevates
the faculties of the soul to the supernatural
sphere, thereby enabling it to perform supernatural
acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Physical is as distinct from moral causality in the order
of grace as in the order of nature. The holding out of
a beautiful toy will not enable a child to walk without
support from its elders. Moral causality is insufficient to
enable a man to perform salutary acts. Grace (as we
shall show later) is absolutely, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> metaphysically, necessary
for all salutary acts, whether easy or difficult, and
hence the incapacity of nature cannot be ascribed solely
to weakness and to the moral difficulty resulting from sin,
but must be attributed mainly to physical impotence. A
bird without wings is not merely impeded but utterly unable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to fly; similarly, man without grace is not only handicapped
but absolutely incapacitated for the work of salvation.
Considered under this aspect, actual grace is
called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia elevans</span></span>, because it elevates
man to the supernatural state.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>

raise him to the supernatural order and thereby
to render him capable of performing supernatural
acts, so that he may attain justification, persevere
in it to the end, and thus enter into everlasting
life.”</span> This definition is strictly scientific, for it

essence of actual grace.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Actual grace may be divided according to: (1) the difference
existing between the faculties of the human soul,
and (2) in reference to the freedom of the will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Considered in its relation to the different faculties of
the soul, actual grace is either of the intellect, or of the
will, or of the sensitive faculties. With regard to the free

coöperating, or (2) efficacious or merely sufficient.

1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Illuminating Grace of the Intellect.</span></span>—Actual
grace, in so far as it inspires salutary
thoughts, is called illuminating (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia illuminationis
s. illustrationis</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This illumination of the intellect by grace may be either
mediate or immediate. It is mediate if grace suggests
salutary thoughts to the intellect by purely natural means,
or external graces, such as a stirring sermon, the perusal
of a good book, etc.; it is immediate when the Holy Ghost
elevates the powers of the soul, and through the instrumentality
of the so-called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia

in it entitatively supernatural acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The existence of the grace of immediate illumination
follows from its absolute necessity as a means of salvation,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The grace of mediate illumination may be
inferred aprioristically from the existence of a divine
revelation equipped with such supernatural
institutions as the Bible, the sacraments, rites,
ceremonies, etc. In conformity with the psychological
laws governing the association of ideas, intelligent
meditation on the agencies comprised under
the term <span class="tei tei-q">“external grace”</span><a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> elicits in the mind
salutary thoughts, which are not necessarily supernatural
in their inception.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not unlikely that Sacred Scripture refers to such
graces as these when it recommends <span class="tei tei-q">“the law of God”</span>
or <span class="tei tei-q">“the example of Christ”</span> as fit subjects for meditation.
Cfr. Ps. XVIII, 8 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“The law of the Lord is unspotted,
converting souls, ... the commandment of the
Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.”</span><a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> 1 Pet. II, 21:

had in mind the grace of mediate illumination when he
wrote: <span class="tei tei-q">“God acts upon us by the incentives of visible
objects to will and to believe, either externally by evangelical
exhortations, ... or internally, as no man has
control over what enters into his thoughts.”</span><a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> The grace
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of mediate illumination has for its object to prepare the
way quietly and unostentatiously for a grace of greater
import, namely, the immediate illumination of the mind
by the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The grace of immediate far surpasses that
of mediate illumination because the supernatural
life of the soul originates in faith, which in turn
is based on a strictly supernatural enlightenment
of the mind.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) St. Paul expressly teaches: <span class="tei tei-q">“And such confidence

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The salient portion of this text reads as follows in
the original Greek: Οὐχ ὅτι ἱκανοί ἐσμεν λογίσασθαί τι ἀφ᾽
ἑαυτῶν ὡς ἐξ ἑαυτῶν, ἀλλ᾽ ἡ ἱκανότης ἡμῶν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Speaking
in the plural (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pluralis maiestaticus</span></span>), the
Apostle confesses himself unable to conceive a single salutary thought
(λογίσασθαι), and ascribes the power (ἱκανότης) to do so to
God. Considered merely as vital acts, such thoughts
proceed from the natural faculties of the mind (ἀφ᾽
ἑαυτῶν), but the power that produces them is divine (ἐκ
Θεοῦ), not human (ἐξ ἑαυτῶν). Hence each salutary
thought exceeds the power of man, and is an immediate
supernatural grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A still more cogent argument can be derived from 1
Cor. III, 6 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have planted, Apollo watered, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God gave the increase. Therefore, neither he that planteth

the increase.”</span><a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> In this beautiful allegory the Apostle
compares the genesis of supernatural faith in the soul to
that of a plant under the care of a gardener, who while he
plants and waters, yet looks to God for <span class="tei tei-q">“the increase.”</span>
The Apostle and his disciple Apollo are the spiritual gardeners
through whose preaching the Corinthians received
the grace of mediate illumination. But, as St. Paul says,
this preaching would have been useless (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non
est aliquid</span></span>)
had not God given <span class="tei tei-q">“the increase.”</span> In other words, the
grace of immediate illumination was necessary to make the
Apostolic preaching effective. <span class="tei tei-q">“For,”</span> in the words of
St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“God Himself contributes to the production
of fruit in good trees, when He both externally
waters and tends them by the agency of His servants, and

according as pious affections and wholesome
resolutions are produced in the soul by a preceding
illumination of the intellect or directly by the
Holy Ghost. Owing to the psychological interaction
of intellect and will, every grace of the
mind, whether mediate or immediate, is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span>
also a mediate grace of the will, which implies a

We are not able to demonstrate this teaching
from Sacred Scripture. The texts John VI, 44
and Phil. II, 13, which are usually adduced in
this connection, are inconclusive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence we must rely solely on Tradition. The
argument from Tradition is based mainly on St.
Augustine. In defending divine grace against
Pelagius, this holy Doctor asserts the indispensability
and superior value of the strengthening
grace of the will.

<span class="tei tei-q">“By that grace it is effected, not only that we discover

yet refuse to follow it.<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>
He insisted that mere knowledge
is not virtue, as Socrates had falsely taught.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ecclesiastical Tradition was always in perfect accord
with this teaching, which eventually came to be defined by
the plenary Council of Carthage (A. D. 418) as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If any one assert that this same grace of God, granted
through our Lord Jesus Christ, helps to avoid sin only for
the reason that it opens and reveals to us an understanding
of the [divine] commands, so that we may know
what we should desire and what we should avoid; but
that it is not granted to us by the same (grace) to desire
and be able to do that which we know we ought to do, let
him be anathema;—since both are gifts of God: to
know what we must do and to have the wish to do it.”</span><a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like the illuminating grace of the intellect the strengthening
grace of the will effects vital acts and manifests
itself chiefly in what are known as the emotions of the
will. St. Prosper, after Fulgentius the most prominent
disciple of St. Augustine, enumerates these as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Fear (for <span class="tei tei-q">‘the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom’</span>);
joy (<span class="tei tei-q">‘I rejoiced at the things that were said to

(<span class="tei tei-q">‘My soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the

more than honey to my mouth’</span>);”</span>—and he adds:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who can see or tell by what affections God visits and
guides the human soul?”</span><a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Actual Graces of the Sensitive Sphere.</span></span>—Though
it cannot be determined with certainty
of faith, it is highly probable that actual grace influences
the sensitive faculties of the soul as well
as the intellect and the will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God, who is the first and sole cause of all things, is
no doubt able to excite in the human imagination phantasms
corresponding to the supernatural thoughts produced
in the intellect, and to impede or paralyze the rebellious
stirrings of concupiscence which resist the grace
of the will,—either by infusing contrary dispositions or
by allowing spiritual joy to run over into the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">appetitus

not necessarily be supernatural except <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quoad modum et
finem</span></span>) may be inferred with great probability from
the fact that man is a compound of body and soul.
Aristotle holds that the human mind cannot think without
the aid of the imagination.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> If this is true, every
supernatural thought must be preceded by a corresponding
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
phantasm to excite and sustain it. As for the sensitive
appetite, it may either assume the form of concupiscence
and hinder the work of salvation, or aid it
by favorable emotions excited supernaturally. St. Augustine
says that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the graces of the intellect and of the will are supernaturally
inspired acts of the soul, by what process does
the mind of man respond to the impulse of illumination
and inspiration?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The language employed by the Fathers and councils
leaves no doubt that supernatural knowledge manifests
itself mainly in judgments. But simple apprehension and
ratiocination must also play a part, (1) because these two
operations are of the essence of human thought, and the
grace of illumination always works through natural
agencies; and (2) because some intellectual apprehensions
are merely condensed judgments and syllogisms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The graces of the will naturally work through the
spiritual emotions or passions, of which there are eleven:
love and hatred, joy and sadness, desire and abhorrence,
hope and despair, fear and daring, and lastly anger.
With the exception of despair (for which there is no
place in the business of salvation), all these passions have
a practical relation to good and evil and are consequently
called <span class="tei tei-q">“graces”</span> both in Scripture and Tradition. Love
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor</span></span>) is the fundamental affection of the
will, to which all others are reducible, and hence the principal function
of grace, in so far as it affects the will, must consist in producing
acts of love.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> The Council of Carthage (A. D.

St. Augustine sometimes employs the word
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span> in
connections where it cannot possibly mean theological
love.<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> This peculiar usage is based on the idea that love
of goodness in a certain way attracts man towards God
and prepares him for the theological virtue of charity.
In studying the writings of St. Augustine, therefore, we
must carefully distinguish between
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span> in the strict,
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>

in the true meaning of the term, and could not exist without
theological charity.

b) Not a few theologians, especially of the Thomist
school, enlarge the list of actual graces by including
therein, besides the supernatural vital acts of the soul,
certain extrinsic, non-vital qualities
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitates fluentes,
non vitales</span></span>) that precede these acts and form their basis.
It is impossible, they argue, to elicit vital or immanent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supernatural acts unless the faculties of the soul have
previously been raised to the supernatural order by means
of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia obœdientialis</span></span>.
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia elevans</span></span>, which
produces in the soul of the sinner the same effects that the
so-called infused habits produce in the soul of the just,
is a supernatural power really distinct from its vital
effects. In other words, they say, the vital supernatural
acts of the soul are preceded and produced by a non-vital
grace, which must be conceived as a <span class="tei tei-q">“fluent quality.”</span>
These <span class="tei tei-q">“fluent”</span> (the opponents of the theory ironically
call them <span class="tei tei-q">“dead”</span>) qualities are alleged to be real graces.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
Alvarez and others endeavor to give their theory a dogmatic
standing by quoting in its support all those passages
of Sacred Scripture, the Fathers and councils in which
prevenient grace is described as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pulsatio</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">excitatio</span></span>,

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tactus</span></span>,
and so forth. The act of knocking or calling,
they say, is not identical with the act of opening, in
fact the former is a grace in a higher sense than the
latter, because it is performed by God alone, while the
response comes from the soul coöperating with God.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>

α) Holy Scripture and Tradition nowhere mention any
such non-vital entities or qualities,—a circumstance
which would be inexplicable if it were true, what Cardinal
Gotti asserts,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> that the term <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> applies primarily
and in the strict sense to these qualities, while the vital
acts are merely effects. Whenever Sacred Scripture, the
Fathers, and the Church speak literally, without the use
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of metaphors, they invariably apply the term <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> to
these vital acts themselves and ascribe their supernatural
character to an immediate act of God.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> In perfect

or <span class="tei tei-q">“non-vital entities”</span> in the dispensation of His grace,
but effects the supernatural elevation of the soul immediately
and by Himself.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>

β) The theory under consideration is inadmissible also
from the philosophical point of view. A quality does not
<span class="tei tei-q">“flow”</span> or tend to revert to nothingness. On the contrary,
its very nature demands that it remain constant until
destroyed by its opposite or by some positive cause. It
is impossible to conceive a quality that would of itself
revert to nothingness without the intervention of a destructive
cause. Billuart merely beats the air when he
says: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Potest dici qualitas incompleta habens se per
modum passionis transeuntis.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> What would Aristotle
have said if he had been told of a thing that was half
ποιόν and half πάσχειν, and consequently neither the one nor
the other? Actual grace is transitory; it passes away with
the act which it inspires, and consequently may be said
to <span class="tei tei-q">“flow.”</span> But this very fact proves that it is not a dead
quality, but a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus vitalis
supernaturalis</span></span>. In the dispensation
of His grace, God employs no fluent qualities
or non-vital entities, but He Himself is the immediate
cause of the supernatural elevation of the human soul and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its faculties. St. Thomas is perfectly consistent, therefore,
when he defines actual grace as a vital act of the
soul.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>

5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Prevenient and Coöperating Grace.</span></span>—The
vital acts of the soul are either spontaneous
impulses or free acts of the will. Grace may
precede free-will or coöperate with it. If it
precedes the free determination of the will it is
called prevenient; if it accompanies (or coincides
with) that determination and merely coöperates
with the will, it is called coöperating grace.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prevenient grace, regarded as a divine call to penance,
is often styled <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia

with a willing heart, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
adiuvans</span></span>. Both species
are distinctly mentioned in Holy Scripture. Cfr.
Eph. V, 14: <span class="tei tei-q">“Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that
sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten
thee.”</span> 2 Tim. I, 9: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who hath delivered us

works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which

world.”</span> Rom. VIII, 26: <span class="tei tei-q">“Likewise the Spirit also helpeth
our infirmity.”</span> Rom. VIII, 30: <span class="tei tei-q">“And whom he
predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called,
them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he
also glorified.”</span> Apoc. III, 20: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold I stand at the
gate and knock. If any man shall hear my voice, and
open to me the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
with him, and he with me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Augustine says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Forasmuch as our turning away
from God is our own act and deed, and this is [our]
depraved will; but that we turn to God, this we cannot do
except He rouse and help us, and this is [our] good will,—what

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An equivalent division is that into <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
operans</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">coöperans</span></span>,
respectively—names which are also founded
on Scripture. Cfr. Phil. II, 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“For it is God who
worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according
to his good will.”</span> Mark XVI, 20: <span class="tei tei-q">“But they going
forth preached everywhere: the Lord working withal, and
confirming the word with signs that followed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Augustine describes the respective functions of
these graces as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“He [God] begins His influence
by working in us that we may have the will, and He
completes it by working with us when we have the
will.”</span><a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A third division of the same grace is that into
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praeveniens</span></span>
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">subsequens</span></span>.
It is likewise distinctly Scriptural,<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">adiuvans</span></span>, as can be seen by comparing
the usage of St. Augustine with that of the Tridentine
Council. <span class="tei tei-q">“God's mercy,”</span> says the holy Doctor, <span class="tei tei-q">“prevents
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> precedes] the unwilling to make him willing; it follows the
willing lest he will in vain.”</span><a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> And the Council
of Trent declares that <span class="tei tei-q">“in adults the beginning of justification
is to be derived from the prevenient grace of
God, through Jesus Christ, that is to say, from His vocation,
whereby, without any merits existing on their part,
they are called.”</span><a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we conceive a continuous series of supernatural
graces, each may be called either prevenient or subsequent,
according as it is regarded either as a cause
or as an effect. St. Thomas explains this as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“As grace is divided into working and coöperating
grace, according to its diverse effects, so it may
also be divided into prevenient and subsequent grace,
according to the meaning attached to the term grace
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, either habitual or actual]. The effects which grace
works in us are five: (1) It heals the soul; (2) moves
it to will that which is good; (3) enables man efficaciously
to perform the good deeds which he wills; (4)
helps him to persevere in his good resolves; and (5)
assists him in attaining to the state of glory. In so far
as it produces the first of these effects, grace is called
prevenient in respect of the second; and in so far as it
produces the second, it is called subsequent in respect of
the first. And as each effect is posterior to one and prior
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to another, so grace may be called prevenient or subsequent
according as we regard it in its relations to different
effects.”</span><a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among so many prevenient graces there must be one
which is preceded by none other
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter praeveniens</span></span>),
and this is preëminently the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia vocans s.
excitans</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a fourth and last division, mentioned by the
Council of Trent, which is also based on the relation of
grace to free-will. <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus Christ Himself,”</span> says the holy
Synod, <span class="tei tei-q">“continually infuses His virtue into the justified,
and this virtue always precedes, accompanies, and follows
their good works.”</span><a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a>
The opposition here lies between
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia antecedens</span></span>,
which is a spontaneous movement of the soul, and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia concomitans</span></span>, which coöperates
with free-will after it has given its consent. This
terminology may be applied to the good works of sinners
and saints alike. For the sinner no less than the just man
receives two different kinds of graces—(1) such as precede
the free determination of the will and (2) such as
accompany his free acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus it can be readily seen that the fundamental division
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of actual grace, considered in its relation to free-will,
is that into prevenient and coöperating grace. All other
divisions are based on a difference of function rather than
of nature.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The existence of prevenient grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
praeveniens s. excitans s. vocans</span></span>) may be inferred
from the fact that the process of justification
begins with the illumination of the intellect,
which is by nature unfree, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> devoid of the
power of choosing between good and evil. That
there are also graces which consist in spontaneous,
indeliberate motions of the will,<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> is clearly
taught by the Council of Trent,<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> and evidenced
by certain Biblical metaphors. Thus God is described
as knocking at the gate (Apoc. III, 20), as
drawing men to Him (John VI, 44), and men are
said to harden their hearts against His voice (Ps.
XCIV, 8), etc. Cfr. Jer. XVII, 23: <span class="tei tei-q">“But they
did not hear, nor incline their ear: but hardened
their neck, that they might not hear me, and might
not receive instruction.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Catholic tradition is voiced by St. Augustine,
who says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The will itself can in no wise
be moved, unless it meets with something which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
delights or attracts the mind; but it is not in the
power of man to bring this about.”</span><a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> St. Prosper
enumerates a long list of spontaneous emotions
which he calls supernatural graces of the
will.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prevenient grace is aptly characterized by the Patristic
formula: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Gratia est
in nobis, sed sine nobis</span></span>,”</span> that is,
grace, as a vital act, is in the soul, but as a salutary act it
proceeds, not from the free will, but from God. In other
words, though the salutary acts of grace derive their
vitality from the human will, they are mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus
hominis</span></span> (θέλησις), not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus humani</span></span>
(βούλησις).<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“God,”</span> explains
St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“does many good things in man,
which man does not do; but man does none which God
does not cause man to do.”</span><a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“[God]
operates without us, in order that we may become willing;
but when we once will so as to act, He coöperates with us.
We can, however, ourselves do nothing to effect good
works of piety without Him either working that we may
will, or coöperating when we will.”</span><a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> St. Bernard employs
similar language.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>

b) Coöperating grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia cooperans s.
adiuvans s. subsequens</span></span>) differs from prevenient
grace in this, that it supposes a deliberate act of
consent on the part of the will (βούλησις, not
θέλησις). St. Gregory the Great tersely explains
the distinction as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The divine goodness
first effects something in us without our coöperation
[<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia praeveniens</span></span>], and then, as the will
freely consents, coöperates with us in performing the good which we desire
[<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
cooperans</span></span>].”</span><a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a>
That such free and consequently meritorious acts
are attributable to grace is emphasized by the
Tridentine Council: <span class="tei tei-q">“So great is the bounty [of
God] towards all men that He will have the things
which are His own gifts to be their merits.”</span><a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>
Such free salutary acts are not only graces in the
general sense, but real actual graces, in as far as
they produce other salutary acts, and their existence
is as certain as the fact that many men freely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
follow the call of grace, work out their salvation,
and attain to the beatific vision. It is only in this
way, in fact, that Heaven is peopled with Saints.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) St. Augustine embodies all these considerations in
the following passage: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is certain that we keep the
commandments when we will; but because the will is
prepared by the Lord, we must ask of Him that we may
will so much as is sufficient to make us act in willing. It
is certain that we will whenever we like, but it is He
who makes us will what is good, of whom it is said
(Prov. VIII, 35): <span class="tei tei-q">‘The will is prepared by the Lord,’</span>
and of whom it is said (Ps. XXXVI, 32): <span class="tei tei-q">‘The steps
of a [good] man are ordered by the Lord, and his way
doth He will,’</span> and of whom it is said (Phil. II, 13): <span class="tei tei-q">‘It
is God who worketh in you, even to will.’</span> It is certain
that we act whenever we set to work; but it is He who
causes us to act, by giving thoroughly efficacious powers
to our will, who has said (Ezech. XXXVI, 27): <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will
cause you to walk in my commandments, and to keep my
judgments, and do them.’</span> When He says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will cause
you ... to do them,’</span> what else does He say in fact than
(Ezech. XI, 19): <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will take away the stony heart out
of their flesh,’</span> from which used to rise your inability to
act, and (Ezech. XXXVI, 26): <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will give you a heart
of flesh,’</span> in order that you may act.”</span><a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) The manner in which grace and free-will coöperate
is a profound philosophical and theological problem. A
salutary act derives its supernatural character from
God, its vitality from the human will. How do these
two factors conjointly produce one and the same
act? The unity of the act would be destroyed if
God and the free-will of man in each case performed,
either two separate acts, or each half of the same
act. To preserve the unity of a supernatural act two
conditions are required: (1) the divine power of grace
must be transformed into the vital strength of the will
and (2) the created will, which by its own power can
perform at most a naturally good act, must be equipped
with the supernatural power of grace. These conditions
are met (a) by the supernatural elevation of the will
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">elevatio externa</span></span>),
and (b) by the supernatural concurrence of God
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus supernaturalis ad actum secundum</span></span>).
The supernatural elevation of the will is accomplished
in this wise: God, by employing the illuminating
and strengthening grace, works on the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia obœdientialis</span></span>,
and thus raises the will above its purely natural
powers and constitutes it a supernatural faculty <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu
primo</span></span> for the free performance of a salutary act. The
divine concursus supervenes to enable the will to perform
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span> or salutary act proper.
This special divine concurrence, in contradistinction to the natural concursus
whereby God supports the created universe,<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> is
a strictly supernatural and gratuitous gift. Consequently,
God and the human will jointly perform one and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same salutary act—God as the principal, the will as the
instrumental cause.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>

salutary act. Whether the certainty of its operation
results from the physical nature of this particular
grace, or from God's infallible foreknowledge
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span>), is a question in dispute

(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agere</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The division of grace into efficacious and
merely sufficient is not identical with that into
prevenient and coöperating. Coöperating grace
does not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex vi notionis</span></span> include with infallible
certainty the salutary act. It may indeed be
efficacious, but in matter of fact frequently fails
to attain its object because the will offers resistance.

a) The existence of efficacious graces is as certain
as that there is a Heaven filled with Saints.

God would be neither omnipotent nor infinitely wise if
all His graces were frustrated by the free-will of man.
St. Augustine repeatedly expresses his belief in the existence
of efficacious graces. Thus he writes in his
treatise on Grace and Free-Will: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is certain that we
act whenever we set to work; but it is He [God] who
causes us to act, by giving thoroughly efficacious powers
to the will.”</span><a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> And in another treatise: <span class="tei tei-q">“[Adam] had

if he would [<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sufficiens</span></span>],

b) Before demonstrating the existence of sufficient
grace it is necessary, in view of certain
heretical errors, carefully to define the term.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) Actual grace may be regarded either in its
intrinsic energy or power (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtus</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potestas agendi</span></span>)

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficacitas</span></span>).
All graces are efficacious considered
in their intrinsic energy, because all confer
the physical and moral power necessary to perform
the salutary act for the sake of which they
are bestowed. From this point of view, therefore,
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu primo</span></span>,
there is no real but a purely
logical distinction between efficacious and merely
sufficient grace. If we look to the final result,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
however, we find that this differs according as
the will either freely coöperates with grace or
refuses its coöperation. If the will coöperates,
grace becomes truly efficacious; if the will resists,
grace remains <span class="tei tei-q">“merely sufficient.”</span> In other
words, merely sufficient grace confers full power
to act, but is rendered ineffective by the resistance
of the will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inefficacy of merely sufficient grace, therefore, is
owing to the resistance of the will and not to any lack of
intrinsic power. This is a truth to which all Catholic
systems of grace must conform.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Merely sufficient grace may be subdivided into <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
proxime sufficiens</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia remote sufficiens</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proximately sufficient grace (also called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia operationis</span></span>)
confers upon the will full power to act forthwith,
while remotely sufficient grace (also termed <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
orationis</span></span>) confers only the grace of prayer, which in its
turn brings down full power to perform other salutary
acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia orationis</span></span> plays a most important
rôle in the divine economy of grace. God has not obliged Himself
to give man immediately all the graces he needs. It is
His will, in many instances, as when we are besieged by
temptations, that we petition Him for further assistance.
<span class="tei tei-q">“God does not enjoin impossibilities,”</span> says St. Augustine,
<span class="tei tei-q">“but in His injunctions He counsels you both to do
what you can for yourself, and to ask His aid in what
you cannot do.”</span><a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence, though grace may sometimes remain ineffective
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia inefficax</span></span> =
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia vere et mere sufficiens</span></span>), it is
never insufficient (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">insufficiens</span></span>),
that is to say, never too
weak to accomplish its purpose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Calvinism and Jansenism, while retaining the
name, have eliminated sufficient grace from their
doctrinal systems.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jansenius (+ 1638) admits a kind of <span class="tei tei-q">“sufficient grace,”</span>
which he calls <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia parva</span></span>,
but it is really insufficient because
no action can result from it unless it is supplemented
by another and more powerful grace.<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> This

far as to assert that <span class="tei tei-q">“in our present state sufficient grace

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) It is an article of faith that there is a merely
sufficient grace and that it is truly sufficient
even when frustrated by the resistance of the
will. The last-mentioned point is emphasized by
the Second Council of Orange (A. D. 529):
<span class="tei tei-q">“This also we believe, according to the Catholic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
faith, that all baptized persons, through the grace
received in Baptism, and with the help and coöperation
of Christ, are able and in duty bound, if
they will faithfully do their share, to comply
with all the conditions necessary for
salvation.”</span><a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>
The existence of sufficient grace was formally defined
by the Council of Trent as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any
one saith that man's free-will, moved and excited
by God, ... no wise coöperates towards disposing
and preparing itself for obtaining the grace
of justification; that it cannot refuse its consent if
it would, ... let him be anathema.”</span><a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This dogma can be convincingly demonstrated
both from Sacred Scripture and Tradition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) God Himself complains through the mouth
of the prophet Isaias: <span class="tei tei-q">“What is there that I
ought to do more to my vineyard, that I have not
done to it? Was it that I looked that it should
bring forth grapes, and it hath brought forth wild
grapes?”</span><a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> This complaint clearly applies
to the Jews. Yahweh did for the Jewish nation whatever
it behooved Him to do lavishly (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
vere sufficiens</span></span>), but His kindness was unrequited
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia mere sufficiens</span></span>). In the Book of
Proverbs He addresses the sinner in these terms:
<span class="tei tei-q">“I called, and you refused: I stretched out my
hand, and there was none that regarded.”</span><a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a>
What does this signify if not the complete sufficiency
of grace? The proffered grace remained
inefficacious simply because the sinner rejected it
of his own free will. Upbraiding the wicked cities
of Corozain and Bethsaida, our Lord exclaims:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the
miracles that have been wrought in you, they had
long ago done penance in sackcloth and ashes.”</span><a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>
The omniscient God-man here asserts the existence
of graces which remained inefficacious in
Corozain and Bethsaida, though had they been
given to the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, they
would have proved effective. The conclusion evidently
is: these graces remained ineffective, not
because they were unequal to the purpose for
which they were conferred, but simply and solely
because they were rejected by those whom God intended
to benefit.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) Though they did not employ the name, the
Fathers were thoroughly familiar with the notion
of sufficient grace.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus St. Irenaeus comments on our Lord's lamentation
over the fate of the Holy City: <span class="tei tei-q">“When He says:
(Matth. XXIII, 37): <span class="tei tei-q">‘How often would I have gathered
together thy children, ... and thou wouldest not,’</span>
He manifests the ancient liberty of man, because God
hath made him free from the beginning.... For God
does not employ force, but always has a good intention.
And for this reason He gives good counsel to all....
And those who do it [<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>] will
receive glory and honor, because they have done good, though
they were free not to do it; but those who do not do
good will experience the just judgment of God, because
they have not done good [<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia inefficax</span></span>],
though they were able to do it
[<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia vere et mere

St. Augustine is in perfect agreement with ecclesiastical tradition,
and the Jansenists had no right whatever to claim
him for their teaching. <span class="tei tei-q">“The grace of God,”</span> he expressly
says in one place, <span class="tei tei-q">“assists the will of men. If
in any case men are not assisted by it, the reason lies with
themselves, not God.”</span><a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“No one is guilty
because he has not received; but he who does not do what
he ought to do, is truly guilty. It is his duty to act if he
has received a free will and amply sufficient power to
act.”</span><a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>

The most important of these is necessity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In treating of the necessity of actual grace we
must avoid two extremes. The first is that mere
nature is absolutely incapable of doing any thing
good. This error was held by the early Protestants
and the followers of Baius and Jansenius.
The second is that nature is able to perform supernatural
acts by its own power. This was
taught by the Pelagians and Semipelagians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between these two extremes Catholic theology
keeps the golden mean. It defends the capacity
of human nature against Protestants and Jansenists,
and upholds its incapacity and impotence
against Pelagians and Semipelagians. Thus our
present Section naturally falls into three Articles.

1. The Vatican Council vindicates the native power of
the human intellect when it says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Catholic
Church, with one consent, has ever held and does hold,
that there is a twofold order of knowledge, distinct both
in principle and in object: in principle, because our knowledge
in the one is by natural reason, and in the other by
divine faith; in object, because, besides those things to
which natural reason can attain, there are proposed to our
belief mysteries hidden in God, which, unless divinely
revealed, cannot be known.”</span><a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> This teaching, which the

Reason tells us that a creature endowed with
intelligence must be capable of acquiring natural knowledge,
and that supernatural faith is based on certain
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praeambula</span></span>, which are nothing else than

But this teaching must be regarded
in the light in which the Church condemned Quesnel's
proposition that <span class="tei tei-q">“All natural knowledge of God, even

presumption, vanity, and opposition against God Himself,

contention that the intrinsic weakness of the human
intellect can be cured only by a primitive revelation
handed down through the instrumentality of speech and
instruction, or by a special interior illumination, involves
the false assumption that there can be a cognitive faculty
incapable of knowledge,—which would ultimately
lead to a denial of the essential distinction between nature
and the supernatural, because it represents exterior revelation
or interior grace as something positively due to
fallen nature.<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> Following the lead of St.

alleged physical incapacity of reason to ascertain these
truths, but on the moral impossibility (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> insuperable
difficulty) of finding them unaided. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is to be ascribed
to this divine Revelation,”</span> says the Vatican Council, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
such truths among things divine as are not of themselves
beyond human reason, can, even in the present state of
mankind, be known by every one with facility and firm
assurance, and without admixture of error.”</span><a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> In conformity
with the teaching of Revelation and Tradition,
the Church has always sharply distinguished between
πίστις and γνῶσις,—faith and knowledge, revelation and
philosophy,—assigning to reason the double rôle of an
indispensable forerunner and a docile handmaid of faith.
Far from antagonizing reason, as charged by her enemies,
the Church has on the contrary always valiantly championed
its rights against Scepticism, Positivism, Criticism,
Traditionalism, Rationalism, Pantheism, and Modernism.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>

of learning many more; yet without a special grace he
could not have learned all the languages spoken on earth,
though their number is by no means infinite. The science
of mathematics, which embraces but a limited field of
knowledge, comprises an indefinite number of propositions
and problems which even the greatest genius can not
master. Add to these impediments the shortness of human
life, the limitations of the intellect, the multitude and
intricacy of scientific methods, the inaccessibility of many
objects which are in themselves knowable, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the

Proof. A man performing moral acts may be
either in a state of unbelief, or of mortal sin, or of
sanctifying grace. The question here at issue is
chiefly whether all the works of pagans, that is all
acts done without grace of any kind, are morally
bad, or whether any purely natural works may be
good despite the absence of grace. Baius and Jansenius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
affirmed this; nay more, they asserted that
no man can perform good works unless he is in
the state of grace and inspired by a perfect love of
God (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>). If this were true, all the
works of pagans and of such Christians as have lost the
faith, would be so many sins. But it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>
true. The genuine teaching of the Church may
be gathered from her official condemnation of
the twenty-fifth, the twenty-sixth, and the thirty-seventh
propositions of Baius. These propositions
run as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Without the aid of God's

admit that there is such a thing as a natural

neighbor is an act of charity, a naturally good deed, common
even among the heathens, and one which, not being
done from a supernatural motive, deserves no supernatural
reward. But this does not by any means imply that to
salute one's neighbor is sinful.

β) The teaching of St. Augustine offers some
difficulties. There can be no doubt that this
Father freely admitted that pagans and infidels
can perform naturally good works without faith
and grace. Thus he says there is no man so
wicked that some good cannot be found in him.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>

Augustine write: <span class="tei tei-q">“Neither doth free-will avail
for anything except sin, if the way of truth is
hidden.”</span><a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a> And what did his disciple Prosper

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To understand these and similar passages
rightly and to explain at the same time how it was
possible for Baius and Jansenius to bolster their
heretical systems with quotations from the writings
of St. Augustine and his disciples, it is necessary
to observe that the quondam rhetorician and
Platonic idealist of Hippo delights in applying to
the genus the designation which belongs to
its highest species, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>.<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> Thus, in
speaking of liberty, he often means the perfect
liberty enjoyed by our first parents in Paradise;<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>
in using the term <span class="tei tei-q">“children of God”</span> he designates
those who persevere in righteousness;<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> and in employing the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“a good work”</span> he means
one supernaturally meritorious. Or, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>,
he designates the slightest good impulse of the
will as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>,”</span>
as it were by anticipation, and brands every unmeritorious work
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">opus informe s. sterile</span></span>)
as false virtue (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">falsa virtus</span></span>), nay sin
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">peccatum</span></span>). To interpret St.
Augustine correctly,
therefore, allowance must be made for his
peculiar idealism and a careful distinction drawn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
between the real and the metaphorical sense of
the terms which he employs. Baius neglected
this precaution and furthermore paid no attention
to the controversial attitude of the holy Doctor.
Augustine's peculiar task was not to maintain the
possibility of naturally good works without faith
and grace, but to defend against Pelagius and
Julian the impossibility of performing supernaturally
good and meritorious works without
the aid of grace. It is this essential difference in
their respective points of view that explains how
St. Augustine and Baius were able to employ
identical or similar terms to express radically different
ideas.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) It can easily be demonstrated on theological
grounds that fallen man is able, of his own initiative,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> without the aid of grace, to perform
morally good works, and that Baius erred in asserting
that this is impossible without theological
faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) With regard to the first-mentioned point it will be
well, for the sake of clearness, to adopt Palmieri's distinction
between physical and moral capacity.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> Man
sins whenever he transgresses the law or yields to temptation.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
This would be impossible if he were physically
unable to keep the whole law and resist temptation.
Hence he must be physically able to do that which
he is obliged to do under pain of sin, though in this or
that individual instance the difficulties may be insuperable
without the aid of grace. To put it somewhat differently:
Baius and Jansenius hold that fallen man can
perform no morally good works because of physical or
moral impotence on the part of the will. This assumption
is false. Man is physically able to perform good
works because they are enjoined by the moral law of
nature under pain of sin; he is morally able because, in
spite of numerous evil tendencies, not a few gentiles and
unbelievers have led upright lives and thereby proved
that man can perform good works without the aid of
grace.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a>

β) It is an expressly defined dogma that the process
of justification starts with theological faith
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides</span></span>), preceded
by the so-called grace of vocation, which prepares
and effects conversion. To say, as Baius did, that
all good works performed in a state of unbelief are so
many sins, is tantamount to asserting that the preliminary
acts leading up to faith, and which the unbeliever performs
by the aid of prevenient grace, are sinful; in other
words, that God requires the unbeliever to prepare himself
for justification by committing sin. This is as absurd
as it is heretical.<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a>

2. We must now define the limitations of fallen

by Providence even for naturally good
deeds are in the present economy

As regards the limitations of man's moral power in
the natural order, we may say, in a general way, that the
will is able to keep the easier precepts of the moral law
of nature without the assistance of grace (either supernatural
or natural). However, as it is impossible in
many instances to determine just where the easier precepts
end and the more difficult ones begin, a broad field is
left open for theological speculation.

proposition just treated, is this: Can the human
will, without the aid of grace, overcome all the
grievous temptations to mortal sin by which it is
besieged?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the common teaching of theologians that, without
the aid of grace, man in the fallen state succumbs with
moral (not physical) necessity to grievous temptations
against the moral law, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to mortal sin. This conclusion
flows from the impossibility, which we have demonstrated
above, of observing the whole law of nature for
life or for any considerable length of time without the
help of grace. If man were able to resist all violent
temptations, he would be able to keep the whole law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The theological teaching which we are here expounding
may be formulated in two different ways: (1) No
man can overcome all grievous temptations against the
moral law without the aid of grace; (2) there is no man
living who is not now and then assailed by temptations
to which he would inevitably succumb did not God lend
him His assistance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In its first and rather indefinite form the proposition
is attacked by Ripalda,<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> Molina,<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> and many later Scholastics.
These writers argue as follows: It is impossible
to deduce from Revelation or experience a definite
rule by which man could determine the conditions on
which the grievousness of a temptation depends. To
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
say that a temptation is grievous when it cannot be resisted
without the aid of grace, would be begging the
question. Besides, the possibility always remains that
there be men who, though in theory unable to withstand
all grievous temptations without the aid of grace,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span>
never meet with such temptations, but only with
the lighter kind which can be overcome without supernatural
help.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second and more specific formulation of our proposition
is supported by Sacred Scripture, which explicitly
declares that all men are subject to temptations which
they could not resist if God did not uphold them.<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>

of sinners and unbelievers. St. Augustine writes against
the Pelagians: <span class="tei tei-q">“Faithful men say in their prayer:

but, above all else, the body of this death?... the carnal
lusts, whence a man is liberated only by the grace of the
Saviour.... He may be permitted to pray that he may
be healed. Why does he presume so strongly on the
capability of his nature? It is wounded, hurt, harassed,
destroyed; what it stands in need of is a true confession
[of its weakness], not a false defense [of its
capacity].”</span><a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>

c) Another question, on which Catholic divines
disagree, is this: Can fallen man, unaided by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to obtain a clear understanding of the question
at issue we shall have to attend to several distinctions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First and above all we must not lose sight of the important
distinction between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supernatural</span></em>
love of God. Supernatural charity, in all its
stages, necessarily supposes supernatural aid. The question
therefore can refer only to the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor Dei naturalis</span></span>.<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>
That this natural charity is no mere figment appears
from the ecclesiastical condemnation of two propositions
of Baius.<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another, even more important distinction is that between
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfect</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imperfect</span></em> charity. Imperfect charity is
the love of God as our highest good (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor Dei ut
summum bonum nobis</span></span>); perfect charity is the love of
God for His own sake above all things (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor Dei
propter se et super omnia</span></span>). The holy Fathers and a
number of councils<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> declare that it is impossible to love
God perfectly without the aid of grace. The context
and such stereotyped explanatory phrases as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sicut
oportet</span></span>”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sicut expedit ad

Patristic and conciliary utterances apply to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supernatural</span></em>
love of God. Hence the question narrows itself
down to this: Can fallen man without the aid of grace
love God for His own sake and above all things by a
purely natural love? In answering this question
Pesch,<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> Tepe,<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> and other theologians distinguish between
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">affective</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effective</span></em> love. They hold that whereas the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor affectivus</span></span>
in all its stages is possible without the aid of grace, not so the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor effectivus</span></span>, since that would involve
the observance of the whole natural law. This compromise
theory can be demonstrated as highly probable
from Scripture and Tradition. St. Paul says<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> that the
gentiles knew God and should have glorified Him. This
evidently supposes that it was possible for them to glorify
God, and consequently to love Him affectively, as
easily and with the same means by which they knew Him.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Else how could the Apostle say of those gentiles who,
<span class="tei tei-q">“when they knew God, glorified him not as God,”</span> that they
<span class="tei tei-q">“changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
served the creature rather than the Creator”</span>?<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> This
interpretation of Rom. I, 21 sqq. is explicitly confirmed by
St. Ambrose when he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“For they were able to apprehend
this by the law of nature, inasmuch as the fabric
of the cosmos testifies that God, its author, is alone to be
loved, as Moses hath set it down in his writings; but they
were made impious by not glorifying God, and unrighteousness
became evident in them when, knowing, they
changed the truth into a lie and refused to confess the
one God.”</span><a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a>

3. It follows, by way of corollary, that Vasquez's
opinion,<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> that there can be no good work
without supernatural aid in the shape of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cogitatio
congrua</span></span>, is untenable, as is also the assertion
of Ripalda<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> that in the present economy purely
natural good actions are so invariably connected
with the prevenient grace of Christ that they
practically never exist as such.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Vasquez, whose position in the matter is opposed
by most other theologians, contends<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a> that no man
can perform a good work or resist any temptation against
the natural law (Decalogue) without the help of supernatural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grace derived from the merits of Christ. To
avoid the heretical extreme of Baianism, however, he
makes a twofold limitation. He assumes with the Scotists
that there is such a thing as a morally indifferent act
of the will,<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a>
and defines the grace which he holds to be
necessary for the performance of every morally good
deed, as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cogitatio congrua</span></span>.
This <span class="tei tei-q">“congruous thought,”</span>
he says, is in itself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> ontologically, natural, and can be
regarded as supernatural only <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quoad
modum et finem</span></span>.
The subtle argument by which Vasquez tries to establish
this thesis is based principally on St. Augustine and may
be summarized as follows: Whenever the Fathers and
councils insist on the necessity of grace for the performance
of good works, they mean <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> good works, natural as
well as supernatural. The only alternative they know
is virtue or vice, good or evil. Consequently the grace of
Christ, in some form or other, is a necessary requisite of
all morally good deeds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we have already intimated, we regard this opinion
of the learned Spanish divine as erroneous.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> Three
solid reasons militate against it. The first is that, to
guard against Baianism, Vasquez is compelled to assume
the existence of morally indifferent acts of the will,
which is untenable, as <span class="tei tei-q">“St. Augustine and St. Thomas,
and theologians generally teach that there is no such
thing in the concrete as a morally indifferent act of the
free will, and consequently, if the will is able, without
grace, to perform acts that are not evil, it is also able
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to perform good acts.”</span><a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a> Second, Vasquez's theory
counterfeits the notion of Christian grace. <span class="tei tei-q">“Good
thoughts”</span> come so natural to man, and are so closely
bound up with the grace of creation, that even Pelagius found no difficulty in
admitting this sort of <span class="tei tei-q">“grace.”</span><a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a>
Surely fallen nature is not so utterly corrupt that a good
child is unable to honor and love his parents without the
aid of <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> (in the sense of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cogitatio congrua ex
meritis Christi</span></span>). The third reason which constrains us
to reject Vasquez's theory, is that it leaves no room for
natural morality (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">naturaliter honestum</span></span>)
to fill the void between those acts that are naturally bad
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">moraliter inhonesta</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">peccata</span></span>)
and such as are supernaturally good
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">supernaturaliter bona</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">salutaria</span></span>).
The existence of such naturally good acts would seem to be a highly
probable inference from the condemnation, by Pius VI, of
a certain proposition taught by the pseudo-Council of
Pistoia.<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Martinez de Ripalda (+1648) tried to improve
Vasquez's theory by restoring the Christian concept of
grace and adding that Providence invariably precedes all
naturally good works, including those performed by
heathens and sinners, with the entitatively supernatural
grace of illumination and confirmation.<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> In this hypothesis
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the necessity of grace is not theological but purely
historic.<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Despite the wealth of arguments by which Ripalda attempted
to prove his theory,<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>
it has not been generally accepted. While some, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
Platel<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> and Pesch,<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> regard it with a degree of sympathy, others,
notably De Lugo<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a>

it may be accepted in a restricted sense, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> when limited
to the faithful.<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ripalda's hypothesis of the universality of grace is truly
sublime and would have to be accepted if God's salvific
will could be demonstrated by revelation or some historic
law to suffer no exceptions. But Ripalda has not been
able to prove this from Revelation.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a> Then, too,
his theory entails two extremely objectionable conclusions:
(1) a denial, not indeed of the possibility (Quesnel), but
of the existence of purely natural good works, and (2) the
possibility of justification without theological faith.
Neither of these difficulties probably occurred to Vasquez
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or Ripalda,<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a> because at the time when they wrote Pius
VI had not yet condemned the teaching of the pseudo-Council

proposition that <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith in a broad sense, as derived from
the testimony of creatures or some other similar motive,
is sufficient for justification.”</span><a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> If the love of God,
even perfect love, (such as we have shown to be possible
in the natural order), were of itself necessarily supernatural,
as Ripalda contends, it would be possible for a
pagan to receive the grace of justification without theological
faith, which he does not possess, as is evident from
the Vatican teaching that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“requisite for divine faith
that revealed truth be believed because of the authority of
God who reveals it.”</span><a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>

Proof. Though this thesis is, strictly speaking,

a formally defined dogma which has been denied
by the Protestant Reformers and by the followers
of Baius and Jansenius. Martin Luther taught,—and
his teaching was adopted in a modified

entirely depraved by original sin, and consequently
man necessarily sins in whatever he

The Jansenist teaching was pushed to an extreme by
Paschasius Quesnel, 101 of whose propositions were
formally condemned by Pope Clement XI in his famous
Constitution <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Unigenitus</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a> The Jansenistic teachings
of the Council of Pistoia were censured by Pius VI, A. D.
1794, in his Bull <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auctorem fidei</span></span>.”</span> The quintessence
of this heretical system is embodied in the proposition
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that whatever a man does in the state of mortal sin is
necessarily sinful for the reason that he is not in the state
of grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">status caritatis</span></span>).
Baius<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a>
and Quesnel<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> gave
this teaching an Augustinian turn by saying that there is
no intermediate state between the love of God and concupiscence,
and that all the works of a sinner must consequently
and of necessity be sinful. This heretical teaching is sharply condemned in
the Bull <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auctorem fidei</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a>
Quesnel pushed it to its last revolting conclusion when he
said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The prayer of the wicked is a new sin, and that
God permits it is but an additional judgment upon
them.”</span><a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The teaching of Baius and Quesnel is repugnant
to Revelation and to the doctrine of
the Fathers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The Bible again and again exhorts sinners
to repent, to pray for forgiveness, to give alms,
etc. Cfr. Ecclus. XXI, 1: <span class="tei tei-q">“My son, thou hast
sinned? Do so no more: but for thy former sins
also pray that they may be forgiven thee.”</span>
Ezech. XVIII, 30: <span class="tei tei-q">“Be converted, and do penance
for all your iniquities: and iniquity shall not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be your ruin.”</span> Dan. IV, 24: <span class="tei tei-q">“Redeem thou thy
sins with alms, and thy iniquities with works of
mercy to the poor: perhaps he will forgive thy
offences.”</span> Zach. I, 3: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus saith the Lord of
hosts: Turn ye to me, saith the Lord of hosts:
and I will turn to you.”</span> If all the works thus enjoined
were but so many sins, we should be
forced to conclude, on the authority of Sacred
Scripture, that God commands the sinner to commit
new iniquities and that the process of justification
with its so-called dispositions consists
in a series of sinful acts. Such an assumption
would be manifestly absurd and blasphemous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Quesnel endeavored to support his heretical conceit by
Matth. VII, 17 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Even so every good tree bringeth
forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil
fruit; a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can
an evil tree bring forth good fruit.”</span> But as our Lord in
this passage speaks of prophets, the fruits he has in
mind must obviously be doctrines not works.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a> And
what if they were works? Are not doctrines and morals
ultimately related, and may we not infer from the lives
they lead (according to their doctrines) whether prophets
are true or false? By their fruits (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> works) you
shall know them (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the soundness or unsoundness of

b) In appealing to the testimony of the Fathers
the Jansenists were notoriously guilty of misinterpretation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) Origen plainly teaches that prayer before justification
is a good work. <span class="tei tei-q">“Though you are sinners,”</span> he says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“pray to God; God hears the sinners.”</span><a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> The seemingly

St. Augustine: <span class="tei tei-q">“He speaks as one not yet anointed; for
God also hears the sinners. If He did not hear sinners,
the publican would have cast his eyes to the ground in
vain and vainly struck his breast saying: O God, be
merciful to me, a sinner.”</span><a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> Moreover, since there is
question here of extraordinary works and signs only (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>
miracles), the text is wholly irrelevant in regard to works
of personal righteousness. St. Prosper teaches: <span class="tei tei-q">“Human
nature, created by God, even after its prevarication,
retains its substance, form, life, senses, and reason,
and the other goods of body and soul, which are not lacking
even to those who are bad and vicious. But there
is no possibility of seizing the true good by such things as
may adorn this mortal life, but cannot give [merit]
eternal life.”</span><a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Baius and Quesnel succeeded in veiling their
heresy by a phraseology of Augustinian color but with
implications foreign to the mind of the Doctor of Grace.
Augustine emphasized the opposition between <span class="tei tei-q">“charity”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“concupiscence”</span> so strongly that the intermediary
domain of naturally good works was almost lost to view.
Thus he says in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enchiridion</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Carnal lust reigns
where there is not the love of God.”</span><a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a> And in his treatise
on the Grace of Christ: <span class="tei tei-q">“Here there is no love, no
good work is reckoned as done, nor is there in fact any
good work, rightly so called; because whatever is not of
faith is sin, and faith worketh by love.”</span><a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a> And again in
his treatise on Grace and Free Will: <span class="tei tei-q">“The commandments
of love or charity are so great and such, that whatever
action a man may think he does well, is by no means
well done if done without charity.”</span><a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a> We have purposely
chosen passages in which the <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctor of
Grace”</span> obviously treats of charity as theological love, not
in the broad sense of
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dilectio</span></span>.<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> At first blush these
passages seem to agree with the teaching of Baius, who
says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Every love on the part of a rational creature is
either sinful cupidity, by which the world is loved, and
which is forbidden by St. John, or that praiseworthy
charity which is infused into the heart by the Holy Spirit,
and by which we love God;”</span>—<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> and with the forty-fifth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proposition of Quesnel: <span class="tei tei-q">“As the love of God no
longer reigns in the hearts of sinners, it is necessary that carnal lust should reign
in them and vitiate all their actions.”</span><a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a>
Yet the sense of these propositions is anything
but Augustinian. Augustine upholds free-will in
spite of grace and concupiscence, whereas the Jansenists
assert that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">carnalis cupiditas</span></span>
and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas dominans</span></span>
produce their effects by the very power of nature, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
necessarily and of themselves.<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides this capital difference there are many minor discrepancies
between the teaching of St. Augustine and that
of Baius and Quesnel. Augustine, it is true, in his struggle
with Pelagianism,<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a> strongly emphasized the opposition
existing between grace and sin, between love of God
and love of the world; but he never dreamed of asserting
that every act performed in the state of mortal sin is sinful
for the reason that it is not performed in the state of
grace. Scholasticism has long since applied the necessary
corrective to his exaggerations. It is perfectly
orthodox to say that there is an irreconcilable opposition
between the state of mortal sin and the state of
grace. <span class="tei tei-q">“No one can serve two masters.”</span><a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> This is
not, however, by any means equivalent to saying, as the
Jansenists do, that the sinner, not being in the state of
grace, of necessity sins in whatever he does. Augustine
expressly admits that, no matter how deeply God
may allow a man to fall, and no matter how strongly
concupiscence may dominate his will, he is yet able to
pray for grace, which is in itself a distinctly salutary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
act. <span class="tei tei-q">“If a sin is such,”</span> he says in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Retractationes</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that it is itself a punishment for sin, what can the
will under the domination of cupidity do, except, if it
be pious, to pray for help?”</span><a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> Compare this sentence
with the fortieth proposition of Baius: <span class="tei tei-q">“The sinner in all his actions serves the
lust which rules him,”</span><a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a> and
you will perceive the third essential difference that separates
the teaching of St. Augustine from that of the Jansenists.
The former, even when he speaks, not of the
two opposing habits, but of their respective acts, does not,
like Jansenism, represent the universality of sin without
theological charity as a physical and fundamental necessity,
but merely as a historical phenomenon which admits of
exceptions. Thus he writes in his treatise On the Spirit
and the Letter: <span class="tei tei-q">“If they who by nature do the things
contained in the law, must not be regarded as yet in the
number of those whom Christ's grace justifies, but rather
as among those whose actions (although they are those
of ungodly men who do not truly and rightly worship the
true God) we not only cannot blame, but actually praise,
and with good reason, and rightly too, since they have
been done, so far as we read or know or hear, according
to the rule of righteousness; though were we to discuss
the question with what motive they are done, they would
hardly be found to be such as to deserve the praise and
defense which are due to righteous conduct.”</span><a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In conclusion we will quote a famous passage from St.
Augustine which reads like a protest against the distortions
of Baius and Jansenius. <span class="tei tei-q">“Love,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
either divine or human; human love is either licit or illicit....
I speak first of licit human love, which is free from
censure; then, of illicit human love, which is damnable;
and in the third place, of divine love, which leads us to
Heaven.... You, therefore, have that love which is
licit; it is human, but, as I have said, licit, so much so
that, if it were lacking, [the want of] it would be censured.
You are permitted with human love to love your
spouse, your children, your friends and fellow-citizens.
But, as you see, the ungodly, too, have this love, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
pagans, Jews, heretics. Who among them does not love
his wife, his children, his brethren, his neighbors, his
relations and friends? This, therefore, is human love.
If any one would be so unfeeling as to lose even human
love, not loving his own children, ... we should no
longer regard him as a human being.”</span><a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a> Tepe pertinently

not only the possibility but the actual existence of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Salutary acts (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus salutares</span></span>) are those
directed to the attainment of sanctifying grace
and the supernatural end of man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to this double purpose, salutary acts may be
divided into two classes: (1) those that prepare for justification
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus simpliciter salutares</span></span>), and (2) those
which, following justification, gain merits for Heaven
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus meritorii</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In consequence of the supernatural character of the
acts which they comprise, both these categories are diametrically
opposed to that class of acts which are good
only in a natural way,<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a>
and hence must be carefully distinguished
from the latter. The Fathers did not, of course,
employ the technical terms of modern theology; they
had their own peculiar phrases for designating what we
call salutary acts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agere sicut oportet vel expedit,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the necessity of grace for all salutary acts is
a fundamental dogma of the Christian religion,
the Church proceeded with unusual severity
against Pelagian naturalism and condemned its
vagaries through the mouth of many councils.

a) Pelagius was a British lay monk, who came
to Rome about the year 400 to propagate his erroneous
views.<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a> He found a willing pupil in Celestius,
who after distinguishing himself as a
lawyer, had been ordained to the priesthood at
Ephesus, about 411.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pelagian heresy gained another powerful champion
in the person of Bishop Julian of Eclanum in Apulia.
Its strongest opponent was St. Augustine. Under his
powerful blows the Pelagians repeatedly changed their
tactics, without however giving up their cardinal error
in regard to grace. Their teaching on this point may be
summarized as follows: The human will is able by
its natural powers to keep all the commandments of God,
to resist temptation, and to gain eternal life; in fact it can attain to a state of
holiness and impeccability<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> in
which the petition <span class="tei tei-q">“Forgive us our trespasses”</span> no longer
has any meaning except perhaps as an expression of humility.<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>
In so far, however, as free-will is itself a gift of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Creator, man can perform no good works without
grace. At a later period of his career Pelagius admitted
the existence of merely external supernatural graces,
such as revelation and the example of Christ and the
saints,—which led St. Augustine to remark: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is
the hidden and despicable poison of your heresy that
you represent the grace of Christ as His example, not
His gift, alleging that man is justified by imitating Him,
not by the ministration of the Holy Spirit.”</span><a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> But even
this external grace, according to Pelagius, does not confer
the strength necessary to perform good works; it
merely makes it easier to keep the commandments.
Pelagius did not deny that justification and adoptive sonship,
considered in their ideal relation to the <span class="tei tei-q">“kingdom
of Heaven,”</span> as distinguished from <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal life,”</span><a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a> are
not identical in adults with the grace of creation, but he
denied their gratuity by asserting that the free will is
able to merit all these graces by its own power.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever may have been the variations of Pelagianism,
it is patent from the writings of St. Augustine that
its defenders one and all rejected the necessity and existence
of the immediate grace of the will.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> Their attitude

grace to be nothing more than to facilitate the work of
salvation.

b) Within the short span of twenty years (A. D.
411 to 431) no less than twenty-four councils
occupied themselves with this new heresy.

At first the wily heretic succeeded in deceiving the
prelates assembled at Lydda (Diospolis), A. D. 415; but
the bishops of Northern Africa, among them St. Augustine,
roundly condemned his teaching at two councils held
with the sanction of Pope Innocent I at Carthage and Mileve
in 416. Shortly afterwards, deceived by the terms of
the creeds and explanations which they circulated, Pope
Zosimus (417-418) declared both Pelagius and Celestius
to be innocent. Despite this intervention, however, two
hundred African bishops, at a plenary council held at
Carthage, A. D. 418, reiterated the canons of Mileve
and submitted them for approval to the Holy See. These
proceedings induced Zosimus to adopt stronger measures.
In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistula Tractoria</span></span> (418) he formally condemned
Pelagianism and persuaded the Emperor to send Julian of
Eclanum and seventeen other recalcitrant bishops into
exile. The canons of Carthage and Mileve were subsequently
received by the universal Church as binding definitions
of the faith. The most important of them in regard
to grace is this: <span class="tei tei-q">“If anyone shall say that the
grace of justification is given to us for the purpose of
enabling us to do more easily by the aid of grace what
we are commanded to do by free-will, as if we were able,
also, though less easily, to observe the commandments of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (A. D. 431), with
the approval of Pope Celestine I, renewed the condemnation
of Celestius, but it was not until nearly a century later
that Pelagianism received its death-blow. In 529 the Second
Council of Orange defined: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one assert that
he is able, by the power of nature, and without the illumination
and inspiration of the Holy Ghost, who grants
to all men the disposition believingly to accept the truth,
rightly (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut expedit</span></span>)

Council of Trent: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one saith that the grace of
God through Jesus Christ is given only for this, that man

a) Among the many Biblical texts that can
be quoted in support of this statement, our
Lord's beautiful parable of the vine and its
branches is especially striking. Cfr. John XV,
4 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless

of purely natural works of the kind for which the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus generalis</span></span> of God suffices, but that
He has in mind salutary acts in the strictly supernatural sense;
and the truth He wishes to inculcate is that fallen nature
cannot perform such acts except through Him and with
His assistance. This supernatural influence is not, however,
to be understood exclusively of sanctifying or
habitual grace, because our Divine Saviour refers to the
fruits of justification and to salutary works. <span class="tei tei-q">“Of these
he does not say: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Without me you can do but little,’</span> but:

β) Nowhere is this fundamental truth so
clearly and insistently brought out as in the
epistles of St. Paul, who is preëminently <span class="tei tei-q">“the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are, according to him, three categories of supernatural
acts: salutary thoughts, holy resolves, and good
works.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Paul teaches that all right thinking is from God.
2 Cor. III, 5: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not that we are sufficient to think anything
of ourselves, as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is
from God.”</span><a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He also declares that all good resolves come from above.
Rom. IX, 15 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“For he saith to Moses: I will have
mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I will shew
mercy to whom I will shew mercy. So then it is not of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The argument from Tradition is based
almost entirely on the authority of St. Augustine,
in whom, as Liebermann observes, God wrought a
miracle of grace that he might become its powerful
defender. There is no need of quoting specific
texts because this whole treatise is interlarded
with Augustinian dicta concerning the necessity
of grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) An important point is to prove that the early Fathers
held the Augustinian, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Catholic view. It stands
to reason that if these Fathers had taught a different
doctrine, the Church would not have so vehemently rejected
Pelagianism as an heretical innovation. Augustine
himself insists on the novelty of the Pelagian teaching.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such is the Pelagian heresy,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“which is not an ancient one, but has
only lately come into existence.”</span><a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a>
And this view is confirmed by Pope Celestine I, who declares
in his letter to the Bishops of Gaul (A. D. 431):
<span class="tei tei-q">“This being the state of the question, novelty should cease
to attack antiquity.”</span><a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In fact the teaching of the Apostolic Fathers, although
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
less explicit, agrees entirely with that of Augustine.
Thus St. Irenaeus says: <span class="tei tei-q">“As the dry earth, if it receives
no moisture, does not bring forth fruit, so we,
being dry wood, could never bear fruit for life without
supernatural rain freely given.... The blessing of salvation
comes to us from God, not from ourselves.”</span><a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The necessity of grace is indirectly inculcated by the
Church when she petitions God to grant salutary graces
to all men—a most ancient and venerable practice, which
Pope St. Celestine explains as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The law of
prayer should determine the law of belief. For when the
priests of holy nations administer the office entrusted to
them, asking God for mercy, they plead the cause of the
human race, and together with the whole Church ask and
pray that the unbelievers may receive the faith, that the
idolaters may be freed from the errors of their impiety,
that the veil be lifted from the heart of the Jews, and
they be enabled to perceive the light of truth, that the
heretics may return to their senses by a true perception
of the Catholic faith, that the schismatics may receive
the spirit of reborn charity, that the sinners be granted
the remedy of penance, and that the door of heavenly
mercy be opened to the catechumens who are led to the
sacraments of regeneration.”</span><a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> In matters of salvation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prayer and grace are correlative terms; the practice of the
one implies the necessity and gratuity of the other.<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) That the Fathers not only conceived grace
to be necessary for the cure of weakness induced
by sin (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sanans</span></span>) in a merely moral sense,
but thought it to be metaphysically necessary for
the communication of physical strength (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
elevans</span></span>), is evidenced by such oft-recurring similes
as these: Grace is as necessary for salvation
as the eye is to see, or as wings are to fly, or as
rain is for the growth of plants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will suffice to quote a passage from the writings of
St. Chrysostom. <span class="tei tei-q">“The eyes,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“are beautiful and
useful for seeing, but if they would attempt to see without
light, all their beauty and visual power would avail them
nothing. Thus, too, the soul is but an obstacle in its own way if
it endeavors to see without the Holy Ghost.”</span><a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This view is strengthened by the further teaching of
the Fathers that supernatural grace was as indispensable
to the angels in their state of probation (in which they
were free from concupiscence) and to our first parents
in Paradise (gifted as they were with the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">donum integritatis</span></span>),
as it is to fallen man; the only difference being
that in the case of the latter, grace has the additional object
of curing the infirmities and overcoming the difficulties
arising from concupiscence. In regard to the
angels St. Augustine says; <span class="tei tei-q">“And who made this will but
He who created them with a good will, that is to say with
a chaste love by which they should cleave to Him, in one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the same act creating their nature and endowing it
with grace?... We must therefore acknowledge, with
the praise due to the Creator, that not only of holy men,
but also of the holy angels, it can be said that <span class="tei tei-q">‘the love of
God is shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost,
who is given unto them.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Equally convincing is the argument that Adam in Paradise
was unable to perform any salutary acts without
divine grace. <span class="tei tei-q">“Just as it is in man's power to die whenever
he will,”</span> says St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“... but the mere will
cannot preserve life in the absence of food and the other
means of life; so man in Paradise was able of his mere
will, simply by abandoning righteousness, to destroy himself;
but to have led a life of righteousness would have
been too much for his will, unless it had been sustained by the power
of Him who made him.”</span><a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is also the teaching of the Second Council of Orange
(A. D. 529): <span class="tei tei-q">“Even if human nature remained in
the state of integrity, in which it was constituted, it would
in no wise save itself without the help of its Creator.
If it was unable, without the grace of God, to keep what

c) The theological argument for the metaphysical
necessity of grace is based on the essentially
supernatural character of all salutary acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) St. Thomas formulates it as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Eternal
life is an end transcending the proportion of human
nature, ... and therefore man, by nature, can perform
no meritorious works proportioned to eternal life, but
requires for this purpose a higher power,—the power
of grace. Consequently, man cannot merit eternal life
without grace. He is, however, able to perform acts
productive of some good connatural to man, such as tilling the soil, drinking, eating,
acts of friendship, etc.”</span><a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a>
For the reason here indicated it is as impossible for man
to perform salutary acts without grace as it would be to
work miracles without that divine assistance which transcends
the powers of nature.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Catholic theologians are unanimous in admitting
that all salutary acts are and must needs be supernatural;
but they differ in their conception of this supernatural
quality (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">supernaturalitas</span></span>).
The problem underlying this
difference of opinion may be stated thus: A thing may
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be supernatural either entitatively,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quoad substantiam</span></span>, or
merely as to the manner of its existence,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quoad modum</span></span>.
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">supernaturale quoad
substantiam</span></span> is divided into the
strictly supernatural and the merely preternatural.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> The
question is: To what category of the supernatural belong
the salutary acts which man performs by the aid of
grace? Undoubtedly there are actual graces which are
entitatively natural, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
the purely mediate grace of illumination,<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a>
the natural graces conferred in the pure state of nature, the
actual graces of the sensitive sphere,<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a> and
the so-called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cogitatio congrua</span></span>
of Vasquez.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> The
problem therefore narrows itself down to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate</span></em>
graces of intellect and will. Before the Tridentine
Council theologians contented themselves with
acknowledging the divinely revealed fact that these graces
are supernatural; it was only after the Council that they
began to speculate on the precise character of this
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">supernaturalitas</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some, following the teaching of the Scotist school,
ascribed the supernatural character of salutary acts to
their free acceptation on the part of God, holding them to
be purely natural in their essence and raised to the supernatural
sphere merely <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per
denominationem extrinsecam</span></span>.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>
This view is untenable. For if nature, as such,
possessed the intrinsic power to perform salutary acts,
irrespective of their acceptation by God, the Fathers
and councils would err in teaching that this power is
derived from the immediate graces of illumination and
strengthening.<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Others hold that the salutary acts which grace enables
man to perform, are supernatural only
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quoad modum</span></span>;
because while it is the Holy Ghost Himself who incites
the natural faculties to salutary thoughts and good resolves,
He does not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span>
raise these thoughts and resolves
to the supernatural plane. This theory, besides being
open to the same objection which we have urged
against the first, involves another difficulty. If all salutary
acts were supernatural only
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quoad modum</span></span>, sanctifying
grace, which is as certainly supernatural in its essence
as the beatific vision of God,<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a> would cease to have an
adequate purpose; for the intrinsic reason for its existence
is precisely that it raises the nature of the justified
into a permanent supernatural state of being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A third school of theologians tries to solve the difficulty
by adding to the natural operation of the intellect and the
will some accidental supernatural
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus</span></span>. There are several
such <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modi</span></span>, which, though inhering in nature and
really distinct therefrom, depend solely on the Holy
Ghost, and consequently transcend the natural powers of
man, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the duration or intensity of a salutary act.
This theory at first blush appears more plausible than the
other two, but it cannot be squared with the teaching of
Tradition. In the first place, the duration or intensity
of a salutary act cannot affect its essence or nature.
Then again, every such accidental supernatural
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus</span></span> is
produced either by grace alone, or by grace working conjointly
with free-will. In the former hypothesis it would
be useless, because it would not render the free salutary
act, as such, supernatural; in the latter case it could do no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more than aid the will to do what is morally impossible,
whereas every salutary act is in matter of fact a physical
impossibility, that is, impossible to unaided nature.<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a>

There remains a fourth explanation, which ascribes to
every salutary act an ontological, substantial, intrinsic
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">supernaturalitas</span></span>,
whereby it is elevated to a higher and
essentially different plane of being and operation. This
theory is convincingly set forth by Suarez in his treatise
on the Necessity of Grace.<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be asked: If the salutary acts which we
perform are supernatural in substance, why are we not
conscious of the fact? The answer is not far to seek.
Philosophical analysis shows that the intrinsic nature of
our psychic operations is no more a subject of immediate
consciousness than the substance of the soul itself.
Consequently, sanctifying grace cannot reveal its presence
through our inner consciousness. Having no intuitive
knowledge of our own Ego, we are compelled
to specify the different acts of the soul by means of their
respective objects and their various tendencies (cognition,
volition). To our consciousness the supernatural
love of God does not present itself as essentially different
from the natural.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>

Unbelief, Mortal Sin, And Justification</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every adult man, viewed in his relation to actual
grace, is in one of three distinct states:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) The state of unbelief
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">status infidelitatis</span></span>), which
may be either negative, as in the case of heathens, or
positive, as in the case of apostates and formal heretics;
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) The state of mortal sin
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">status peccati mortalis</span></span>),
when the sinner has already received, or not yet lost,
the grace of faith, which is the beginning of justification;
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) The state of justification itself (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">status iustitiae
sive gratiae sanctificantis</span></span>), in which much remains yet
to be done to attain eternal happiness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question we have now to consider is: Does man
need actual grace in every one of these three states, and
if so, to what extent?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Semipelagianism.</span></span>—Semipelagianism is an
attempt to effect a compromise between Pelagianism
and Augustinism by attributing to mere nature
a somewhat greater importance in matters of
salvation than St. Augustine was willing to admit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) After Augustine had for more than twenty years
vigorously combatted and finally defeated Pelagianism,
some pious monks of Marseilles, under the leadership
of John Cassian, Abbot of St. Victor,<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> tried to find
middle ground between his teaching and that of the
Pelagians. Cassian's treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Collationes
Patrum</span></span>,<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a> and
the reports sent to St. Augustine by his disciples Prosper
and Hilary, enable us to form a pretty fair idea of
the Semipelagian system. Its principal tenets were the
following:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) There is a distinction between the <span class="tei tei-q">“beginning of
faith”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">initium fidei</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">affectus credulitatis</span></span>) and <span class="tei tei-q">“increase
in faith”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">augmentum fidei</span></span>).
The former depends entirely
on the will, while the latter, like faith itself, requires
the grace of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Nature can merit grace by its own efforts, though
this natural merit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum naturae</span></span>)
is founded on equity only
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum de congruo</span></span>), and does not confer
a right in strict justice, as Pelagius contended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
γ) Free-will, after justification, can of its own power
secure the gift of final perseverance
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">donum perseverantiae</span></span>);
which consequently is not a special grace, but
a purely natural achievement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
δ) The bestowal or denial of baptismal grace in the case
of infants, who can have no previous
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">merita de congruo</span></span>,
depends on their hypothetical future merits or demerits as
foreseen by God from all eternity.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Informed of these errors by his disciples, St.
Augustine energetically set to work, and in spite
of his advanced age wrote two books against the
Semipelagians, entitled respectively, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Praedestinatione
Sanctorum</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Dono Perseverantiae</span></span>.
The new teaching was not yet, however,
regarded as formally heretical, and Augustine
treated his opponents with great consideration,
in fact he humbly acknowledged that he himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had professed similar errors before his consecration
(A. D. 394).<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After Augustine's death, Prosper and Hilary
went to Rome and interested Pope Celestine in
their cause. In a dogmatic letter addressed to
the Bishops of Gaul, the Pontiff formally approved
the teaching of St. Augustine on grace and
original sin, but left open such other <span class="tei tei-q">“more profound
and difficult incidental questions”</span> as predestination
and the manner in which grace operates
in the soul.<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a> But as this papal letter (called
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Indiculus</span></span>”</span>) was an instruction rather than an
ex-cathedra definition, the controversy continued
until, nearly a century later (A. D. 529), the
Second Council of Orange, convoked by St.
Caesarius of Arles, formally condemned the Semipelagian
heresy. This council, or at least its first
eight canons,<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a> received the solemn approbation of
Pope Boniface II (A. D. 530) and thus became
vested with ecumenical authority.<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a>

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Teaching of the Church.</span></span>—The
Catholic Church teaches the absolute necessity of
actual grace for all stages on the way to salvation.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
We shall demonstrate this in five separate
theses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Thesis I: Prevenient grace is absolutely necessary,
not only for faith, but for the very beginning of faith.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de fide</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. The Second Council of Orange defined
against the Semipelagians: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one say that
increase in faith, as well as the beginning of faith,
and the very impulse by which we are led to believe
in Him who justifies the sinner, and by which
we obtain the regeneration of holy Baptism, is in
us not as a gift of grace, that is to say, through
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, but by nature, ...
is an adversary of the dogmatic teaching of
the Apostles....”</span><a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) This is thoroughly Scriptural doctrine, as
St. Augustine<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> and Prosper<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> proved. St.
Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians had opened
the eyes of Augustine, as he himself admits. 1
Cor. IV, 7: <span class="tei tei-q">“For who distinguisheth<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a> thee?
Or what hast thou that thou hast not received?
And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory,
as if thou hadst not received it?”</span> The Apostle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
means to say: In matters pertaining to salvation
no man has any advantage over his fellow men,
because all receive of the grace of God without
any merits of their own. This statement would
be false if any man were able to perform even the
smallest salutary act without the aid of grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With a special view to faith the same Apostle teaches:
<span class="tei tei-q">“For by grace you are saved through faith,<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> and that
not of yourselves,<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> for it is the gift of
God;<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a> not of
works,<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a> that no man may glory.”</span><a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a>
This, too, would be false if faith could be traced to a purely natural instinct
or to some <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum de congruo</span></span> in the
Semipelagian sense.<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> Our Lord Himself, in his famous
discourse on the Holy Eucharist, unmistakably describes
faith and man's preparation for it as an effect of prevenient
grace. <span class="tei tei-q">“No man can come to me, except the
Father, who hath sent me, draw him.”</span><a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a> The metaphorical
expression <span class="tei tei-q">“come to me,”</span> according to the context,
means <span class="tei tei-q">“believe in me;”</span> whereas the Father's
<span class="tei tei-q">“drawing”</span> plainly refers to the operation of prevenient
grace. Cfr. John VI, 65 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“But there are some of
you that believe not.... Therefore did I say to you,
that no man can come to me, unless it be given him
by the Father.”</span> John VI, 29: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the work of
God,<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a> that you believe in him whom he hath sent.”</span> According
to our Saviour's own averment, therefore,
preaching is of no avail unless grace gives the first impulse
leading to faith.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) As regards the argument from Tradition, it
will suffice to show that the Fathers who wrote
before Augustine, ascribed the beginning of faith
to prevenient grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) In the light of the Augustinian dictum that <span class="tei tei-q">“prayer
is the surest proof of grace,”</span><a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> it is safe to assume that
St. Justin Martyr voiced our dogma when he put into the
mouth of a venerable old man the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“But thou
pray above all that the gates of light may be opened
unto thee; for no man is able to understand the words
of the prophets [as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praeambula fidei</span></span>]
unless God and His
Christ have revealed their meaning.”</span><a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href="#note_316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> Augustine himself
appeals to SS. Cyprian, Ambrose, and Gregory of
Nazianzus, and then continues: <span class="tei tei-q">“Such doctors, and so
great as these, saying that there is nothing of which we
may boast as of our own, which God has not given
us; and that our very heart and our thoughts are not
in our own power, ... attribute these things to the
grace of God, acknowledge them as God's gifts, testify that they come to us
from Him and are not from ourselves.”</span><a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Like the Pelagians in their teaching on original
sin,<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> the Semipelagians in their teaching on grace relied
mainly on the authority of St. John Chrysostom,
from whose writings they loved to quote such perplexing
passages as this: <span class="tei tei-q">“We must first select the good,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and then God adds what is of His; He does not forestall
our will because He does not wish to destroy our liberty.
But once we have made our choice, He gives us
much help. For while it rests with us to choose and to
will antecedently, it lies with him to perfect and bring to
an issue.”</span><a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To understand St. Chrysostom's attitude, and that
of the Oriental Fathers generally, we must remember
that the Eastern Church considered it one of its chief
duties to safeguard the dogma of free-will against the
Manichaeans, who regarded man as an abject slave
of Fate. In such an environment it was of supreme
importance to champion the freedom of the will<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> and
to insist on the maxim: <span class="tei tei-q">“Help yourself and God will
help you.”</span> If the necessity of prevenient grace was
not sufficiently emphasized, the circumstances of the time
explain, and to some extent excuse, the mistake. St. Augustine
himself remarks in his treatise on the Predestination
of the Saints: <span class="tei tei-q">“What need is there for us to look
into the writings of those who, before this heresy sprang
up, had no necessity of dwelling on a question so difficult
of solution as this, which beyond a doubt they would do
if they were compelled to answer such [errors as these]?
Whence it came about that they touched upon what they
thought of God's grace briefly and cursorily in some passages
of their writings.”</span><a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> Palmieri remarks<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> that it
would be easy to cite a number of similar passages from
the writings of the early Latin Fathers before Pelagius,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who certainly cannot be suspected of Semipelagian leanings.<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The orthodoxy of St. Chrysostom can be positively
established by a twofold argument. (1) Pope Celestine
the First recommended him as a reliable defender of the Catholic faith against
Nestorianism and Pelagianism.<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>
(2) Chrysostom rejected Semipelagianism as it
were in advance when he taught: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not even faith is
of ourselves; for if He [God] had not come, if He had not called,
how should we have been able to believe?”</span><a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>
and again when he says in his explanation of the Pauline
phrase ἀρχηγὸς τῆς πίστεως:<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“He Himself hath
implanted the faith in us, He Himself hath given the
beginning.”</span><a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> These utterances are diametrically opposed
to the heretical teaching of the Semipelagians.<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The theological argument for our thesis is
effectively formulated by Oswald<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a> as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is faith which first leads man from the sphere
of nature into a higher domain,—faith is the beginning
of salutary action. That this beginning
must come wholly from God, and that it cannot
come from man, goes without saying. By beginning
we mean the very first beginning.
Whether we call this first beginning itself faith,
or speak, as the Semipelagians did, of certain preambles
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of faith,—aspirations, impulses, desires
leading to faith (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praeambula fidei: conatus, desideria,
credulitatis affectus</span></span>), makes no difference.
Wherever the supernatural domain of salutary
action begins—and it is divided off from the
natural by a very sharp line—there it is God who
begins and not man, there it is grace which
precedes,—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
praeveniens</span></span>, as it has come to be
known by a famous term.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed, if man were able by his own power to merit
for himself the first beginnings of grace, then faith itself,
and justification which is based on faith, and the
beatific vision, would not be strictly graces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for the precise moment when prevenient grace begins
its work in the soul, the common opinion is that
the very first judgment which a man forms as to the
credibility of divine revelation
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">iudicium credibilitatis</span></span>) is determined
by the immediate grace of the intellect,<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a>
and that the subsequent <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">affectus
credulitatis</span></span> springs from
the strengthening grace of the will. St. Augustine,
commenting on 2 Cor. III, 5, demonstrates this as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let them give attention to this, and well weigh
these words, who think that the beginning of faith is
of ourselves, and the increase of faith is of God. For
who cannot see that thinking is prior to believing? For
no one believes anything unless he has first thought that

Proof. The Semipelagians ascribed the dispositions
necessary for justification to the natural
efforts of the will, thereby denying the necessity
of prevenient grace. This teaching was condemned

grace, not only at the beginning of every salutary

St. Augustine clearly perceived this. <span class="tei tei-q">“That he might

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus he writes in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enchiridion</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely, if no
Christian will dare to say this: It is not of God that
showeth mercy, but of man that willeth, lest he should
openly contradict the Apostle, it follows that the true
interpretation of the saying (Rom. IX, 16): <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is not
of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
God that showeth mercy,’</span> is that the whole work belongs
to God, who both prepares the good will that is to
be helped, and assists it when it is prepared. For the good
will of man precedes many of God's gifts, but not all; and
it must itself be included among those which it does not
precede. We read in Holy Scripture, both <span class="tei tei-q">‘God's mercy
shall prevent me’</span> (Ps. LVIII, 11), and <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thy mercy will
follow me’</span> (Ps. XXII, 6). It precedes the unwilling to
make him willing; it follows the willing to render his will
effectual. Why are we taught to pray for our enemies,
who are plainly unwilling to lead a holy life, unless it
be that God may work willingness in them? And why
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are we admonished to ask that we may receive, unless
it be that He who has created in us the wish, may Himself
satisfy the same? We pray, then, for our enemies,

preceded us; we pray for ourselves, that His mercy may
follow us.”</span><a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>

the Apostle says (Phil. II, 13): <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is God who worketh

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. The faculties of the just man are permanently
kept in the supernatural sphere by sanctifying
grace and by the habits of faith, hope, and
charity. Hence the just man in the performance
of salutary acts does not require the same measure
of prevenient grace as the unregenerate sinner,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who lacks all, or at least some, of the habits mentioned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question here at issue, therefore, can only be:
Is actual grace (as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
excitans s. vocans</span></span>, not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">elevans</span></span>)
absolutely necessary to enable a man in the state of
sanctifying grace to perform salutary acts? The answer
is—Yes, and this teaching is so firmly grounded on Sacred
Scripture and Tradition, and so emphatically sanctioned
by the Church, that we do not hesitate to follow Perrone
in qualifying it as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de
fide</span></span>.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a> The councils in
their teaching on the necessity of grace, assert that necessity
alike for the justified and the unjustified. That of
Trent expressly declares: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whereas Jesus Christ Himself
continually infuses His virtue into the justified,—as
the head into the members, and the vine into the branches,—and
this virtue always precedes and accompanies and
follows their good works, which without it could not in
any wise be pleasing and meritorious before God, we must
believe that nothing further is wanting to the justified....”</span><a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Our thesis can be easily proved from Holy
Scripture. We have already shown that the
Bible and Tradition make no distinction between
the different stages on the way to salvation, or
between different salutary acts, but indiscriminately
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
postulate for all the illuminating grace of
the intellect and the strengthening grace of
the will. It follows that to perform salutary acts
the justified no less than the unjustified
need actual grace. Our Saviour's pithy saying:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Without me you can do nothing,”</span><a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> was not addressed
to unbelievers or sinners, but to His Apostles,
who were in the state of sanctifying grace.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This interpretation is fully borne out by Tradition.
St. Augustine, after laying it down as a general principle
that <span class="tei tei-q">“We can of ourselves do nothing to effect good
works of piety without God either working that we
may will, or co-operating when we will,”</span><a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> says of justified
man in particular: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Heavenly Physician
cures our maladies, not only that they may cease to exist,
but in order that we may ever afterwards be able
to walk aright,—a task to which we should be unequal,
even after our healing, were it not for His continued
help.... For just as the eye of the body, even
when completely sound, is unable to see, unless aided by
the brightness of light, so also man, even when fully justified,
is unable to lead a holy life, unless he be divinely assisted
by the eternal light of righteousness.”</span><a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This agrees with the practice of the Church in exhorting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all men without exception, saints as well as

b) Some theologians have been led by certain
speculative difficulties to deny the necessity of actual
grace in the state of justification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Man in the state of justification, they argue, is endowed
with sanctifying grace, the supernatural habits
of faith, hope, and charity, and the infused moral virtues,
and consequently possesses all those qualifications
which are necessary to enable him to perform salutary
acts with the supernatural concurrence of God. Why
should the will, thus supernaturally equipped, require
the aid of additional actual graces to enable it to perform
strictly supernatural, and therefore salutary, actions?<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We reply: The necessity of actual grace in the
state of justification is so clearly taught by divine Revelation
that no theological theory is tenable which denies
it. Besides, the objection we have briefly summarized
disregards some very essential considerations, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> that
there remains in man, even after justification, concupiscence,
which is accompanied by a certain weakness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that requires at least the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sanans
sive medicinalis</span></span> to heal it.<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> Furthermore,
a quiescent <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus</span></span> cannot
set itself in motion, but must be determined from without;
that is to say, in our case, it must be moved by
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia excitans</span></span>
to elicit supernatural thoughts and
to will supernatural acts. Just as a seed cannot sprout
without the aid of appropriate stimuli, so sanctifying
grace is incapable of bearing fruit unless stimulated by
the sunshine and moisture of actual graces. Man may
perform purely natural acts even though he be in the
supernatural state of grace; hence if any particular act
of his is to be truly supernatural and conducive to eternal
salvation, God must lend His special aid.<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a>

point is the following declaration of the Council of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To obtain a better understanding of this Tridentine
definition it will be well to ponder the following considerations:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Council declares that it is impossible for man,
even in the state of sanctifying grace, to avoid all sins
during his whole life, except by virtue of a special privilege
such as that enjoyed by the Blessed Virgin Mary.<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a>
A venial sin is one which, because of the unimportance
of the precept involved, or in consequence of incomplete
consent, does not destroy the state of grace. Such
a sin may be either deliberate or semi-deliberate. A
semi-deliberate venial sin is one committed in haste
or surprise. It is chiefly sins of this kind that the
Tridentine Council had in view. For no one would
seriously assert that with the aid of divine grace a saint
could not avoid at least all deliberate venial sins for a
considerable length of time. The phrase
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in tota vita</span></span>”</span>
indicates a period of some length, though its limits are
rather difficult to determine. Were a man to die immediately
after justification, the Tridentine canon would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per accidens</span></span>
not apply to him. As the Council says in
another place that <span class="tei tei-q">“men, how holy and just soever, at
times fall into at least light and daily sins, which are also
called venial,”</span><a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a> it is safe practically to limit the period
of possible freedom from venial sin to one day. Theoretically,
of course, it may be extended much farther.
The phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">omnia
peccata</span></span>”</span> must be interpreted collectively,
not distributively, for a sin that could not be avoided
would cease to be a sin. For the same reason the term
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non posse</span></span>”</span>
must be understood of (moral, not physical)
disability; in other words, the difficulty of avoiding sin
with the aid of ordinary graces for any considerable
length of time, is insuperable even for the just. This
moral impossibility of avoiding sin can be removed only
by a special privilege, such as that enjoyed by the
Blessed Virgin Mary. It may incidentally be asked
whether this privilege was also granted to other saints,
notably St. Joseph and St. John the Baptist. Suarez lays
it down as a theological conclusion that no human being
has ever been or ever will be able entirely to avoid
venial sin except by a special privilege, which must in
each case be proved. Palmieri maintains that the moral
impossibility of leading an absolutely sinless life without
the special assistance of grace is taught by indirection in
the canons of Mileve (416) and Carthage (418), which
declare that no such life has ever been led by mortal man
without that assistance.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>

fully developed by the councils just mentioned.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The careful student will note, however, that those
texts only are strictly conclusive which positively
and exclusively refer to venial sins. Thus when
St. James says: <span class="tei tei-q">“In many things we all offend,”</span><a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a>
he cannot mean that all Christians now
and then necessarily commit mortal sin. For St.
John expressly declares that <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever abideth
in him [Christ], sinneth not.”</span><a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>

It follows that not even the just can wholly
avoid venial sin. Hence the most devout and
pious Christian may truthfully repeat the petition
of the Lord's Prayer which says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Forgive us
our trespasses,<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a> as we forgive those who trespass

Other Scripture texts commonly cited in confirmation
of our thesis lack cogency, because they either deal
exclusively with mortal sin or do not refer to sin
at all. Thus Prov. XXIV, 16: <span class="tei tei-q">“A just man shall fall

to our merits.... The second, that no one
lives in this corruptible body in righteousness of

holy Doctor replies: <span class="tei tei-q">“With all his acuteness he
[Pelagius] overlooks the circumstance that even
righteous persons pray with good reason: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Forgive
us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.’</span>...

die without sin, whilst the sin committed in ignorance or infirmity

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) We come to the theological argument. The
moral impossibility of avoiding venial sin for any
considerable length of time results partly from
the infirmity of human nature
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">infirmitas naturae</span></span>),
partly from God's pre-established plan of
salvation (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ordo divinae providentiae</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The infirmity of human nature flows from four
separate and distinct sources: (1) concupiscence (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fomes
peccati</span></span>); (2) imperfection of the ethical judgment
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">imperfectio iudicii</span></span>);
(3) inconstancy of the will (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inconstantia
voluntatis</span></span>); and (4) the weariness caused by continued
resistance to temptation. In view of these agencies
and their combined attack upon the will, theologians speak
of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas antecedens
peccandi</span></span>;—not as if the
will were predestined to succumb to any one temptation
in particular, but in the sense that it is morally
unable to resist the whole series
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">suppositione disiunctâ</span></span>).
The will simply grows weaker and weaker,
and in course of time fails to resist sin with sufficient
energy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us exemplify. The proofsheets of a book are
scrutinized by several trained readers, yet in spite of
the greatest care and many ingenious devices for the
elimination of error, a perfect book, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> one entirely
free from mistakes, is a practical impossibility. How
much harder must it be for man to avoid moral lapses
throughout his whole life, considering that he cannot
choose his own time for meeting temptations, but must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
keep his mind and will under constant control and be
prepared to resist the enemy at any moment.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Thomas Aquinas says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Man cannot avoid all
venial sin, because his sensual appetite is depraved.
True, reason is able to suppress the individual stirrings
of this appetite. In fact, it is on this account that they
are voluntary and partake of the nature of sin. But
reason is not able to suppress them all [collectively],
because, while it tries to resist one, there perhaps arises
another, and, furthermore, reason is not always in a
condition to exercise the vigilance necessary to avoid
such impulses.”</span><a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It follows that the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas peccandi antecedens</span></span>
does not destroy the liberty of the will or the moral
imputability of those venial sins which a man actually
commits; for it is merely a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas
indeterminata</span></span>,
which refers not to certain particular instances, but
to the one or other indeterminately. It follows further
that God does not command the impossible when He
insists that we should avoid venial sin, for He does not in
each single case command something which is physically
or morally impossible,<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a> but merely demands a perfection
which in itself is not entirely unattainable
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">hic et nunc</span></span>
with the assistance of ordinary grace.<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>

β) The second theological reason for the impossibility
of avoiding venial sin for any considerable time is based
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the eternal scheme of salvation decreed by Divine
Providence. This scheme of salvation must not, of
course, be conceived as a divine precept to commit venial
sins. It is merely a wise toleration of sin and a just refusal,
on the part of the Almighty, to restore the human
race to that entirely unmerited state of freedom
from concupiscence with which it was endowed in Paradise,
and which alone could guarantee the moral possibility
of unspotted innocence. Both factors in their
last analysis are based upon the will of God to exercise
those whom He has justified in humility and to safeguard
us against pride, which is the deadliest enemy
of our salvation.<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> In making this wise decree God, of
course, infallibly foresaw that no man (with the sole
exception of those to whom He might grant a special
privilege) would <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de
facto</span></span> be able to pass through life
without committing venial sins. This infallible foreknowledge
is based not alone on the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span>, but
also on the infirmity of human nature.

Perfect perseverance is the preservation of baptismal
innocence, or, in a less strict sense, of the state of
grace, until death. Imperfect perseverance is a temporary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
continuance in grace, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> for a month or a year,
until the next mortal sin. Imperfect perseverance, according
to the Tridentine Council, requires no special
divine assistance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">speciale

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Final perseverance is either passive or active, according
as the justified dies in the state of grace irrespective of his
will (as baptized children and insane adults),<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href="#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> or actively
coöperates with grace whenever the state of grace is imperilled
by grievous temptation. The Council of Trent
has especially this latter case in view when it speaks of
the necessity of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">speciale
auxilium</span></span>, because the special
help extended by God presupposes coöperation with grace,
and man cannot strictly speaking coöperate in a happy
death. The Council purposely speaks of an
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">auxilium</span></span>, not
a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">privilegium</span></span>,
because a privilege is by its very nature
granted to but few, while the special help of grace extends
to all the elect. This <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">auxilium</span></span>
is designated as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">speciale</span></span>,
because final perseverance is not conferred with sanctifying
grace, nor is it a result of the mere power of
perseverance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">posse
perseverare</span></span>). The state of sanctifying
grace simply confers a claim to ordinary graces,
while the power of perseverance of itself by no means
insures actual perseverance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actu
perseverare</span></span>). The
power of perseverance is assured by those merely sufficient
graces which are constantly at the command of
the righteous. Actual perseverance, on the other hand,
implies a series of efficacious graces. God is under no
obligation to bestow more than sufficient grace on any
man; consequently, final perseverance is a special grace,
or, more correctly, a continuous series of efficacious graces.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Sacred Scripture represents final perseverance
as the fruit of prayer and as a special gift
not included in the bare notion of justification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) Our Divine Saviour Himself says in His prayer
for His disciples, John XVII, 11: <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Father, keep
them in thy name whom thou hast given me, that they
may be one, as we also are.”</span><a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a> St. Paul teaches in his

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) That perseverance is not included in the bare notion
of justification appears from such passages as these:
Phil. I, 6: <span class="tei tei-q">“Being confident of this very thing, that he
who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto
the day of Christ Jesus.”</span><a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a> 1 Pet. I, 5: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who, by the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The threads of Tradition run together in
the hands of St. Augustine, who has written a
special treatise On the Gift of Perseverance.<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His main argument is based on the necessity of prayer.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why,”</span> he asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“is that perseverance asked for from
God, if it is not given by God? Is it a mocking petition
inasmuch as that is asked of Him which it is known
He does not give, but, although He gives it not, is in
man's power?... Or is not that perseverance, perchance,
asked for from Him? He who says this, is not to
be rebuked by my arguments, but must be overwhelmed
with the prayers of the saints. Is there indeed one among
them who do not ask for themselves from God that they
may persevere in Him, when in that very prayer which is
called the Lord's—because the Lord taught it—whenever
it is prayed by the saints, scarcely anything else is understood
to be prayed for but perseverance?”</span><a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a> He then
proceeds to show, in accordance with St. Cyprian's little
treatise On the Lord's Prayer, that the seven petitions
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Our Father”</span> are all prayers for perseverance,
and concludes as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Truly in this matter let
not the Church look for laborious disputations, but consider
her own daily prayers. She prays that the unbelieving
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may believe; therefore God converts to the faith.
She prays that believers may persevere; therefore God
gives perseverance to the end.”</span><a id="noteref_397" name="noteref_397" href="#note_397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">397</span></span></a> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“For
who is there that would groan with a sincere desire to
receive what he prays for from the Lord, if he thought
that he received it from himself and not from the
Lord?”</span><a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) From this teaching flows a corollary of
great practical importance, to wit: The grace of
final perseverance cannot be merited by good
works, but it can be obtained by pious and unremitting
prayer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This gift of God,”</span> says St. Augustine, speaking of
final perseverance, <span class="tei tei-q">“may be obtained suppliantly [by

contumaciously.”</span><a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a>
And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Since it is manifest that
God has prepared some things to be given even to those
who do not pray for them, such as the beginning of faith,
and other things not to be given except to those who pray
for them, such as perseverance unto the end, certainly he
who thinks that he has this latter from himself, does not
pray to obtain it.”</span><a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a>

de condigno</span></span>),
God would be in justice bound to give him this
precious grace. But this is plainly incompatible with the
Catholic conception of final perseverance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be asked: Is God determined by the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum
de congruo</span></span> inherent in all good works to grant the gift
of final perseverance as a reward to the righteous?
Theologians are at variance on this point. Ripalda<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>
thinks that this is the case at least with the more conspicuous
good works performed in the state of grace.
Suarez modifies this improbable contention somewhat by
saying that prayer alone can infallibly guarantee final
perseverance.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> Our prayers are infallibly heard if we
address the Father through Jesus Christ, because Christ
has promised: <span class="tei tei-q">“If you ask the Father anything in my
name, he will give it you.”</span><a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a> To insure its being infallibly
heard, prayer for perseverance must be made in the
state of grace and unremittingly. True, Christ did not
make sanctifying grace a necessary condition of efficacious
prayer. But, as Suarez points out, prayer cannot
be infallibly efficacious unless it proceeds from one who
is in the state of grace, because the moral conditions that
render it efficacious are found only in that state.<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> As to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the second point, if we say that prayer for perseverance
must be unremitting, we mean, in the words of the same
eminent theologian, that it must continue throughout life
and must be made with becoming trustfulness and zeal,
especially when there is a duty to be fulfilled or a temptation
to be overcome.<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All grace <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex vi termini</span></span> is a free
gift.<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a> This
applies particularly to Christian grace, which is
so absolutely gratuitous that its gratuity, together
with its necessity, may be called the groundwork
of the Catholic religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">State of the Question.</span></span>—To show what is
meant by <span class="tei tei-q">“gratuity”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratuitas</span></span>)
we must first
explain the technical term <span class="tei tei-q">“merit.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) <span class="tei tei-q">“Merit”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum</span></span>=that which is earned)
is that property of a good work which entitles the
performer to receive a reward from him to whose
advantage the work redounds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) An analysis of this definition shows that (1) merit
is found only in such works as are positively good;
(2) merit and reward are correlative terms which postulate
each other; (3) merit supposes two distinct persons,
one who deserves and another who awards; (4) the
relation between merit and reward is based on justice,
not on benevolence or mercy. The last-mentioned determination
is by far the most important of the four.<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Ethics and theology clearly distinguish two
kinds of merit: (1) condign merit,<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> which is merit
in the strict sense (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum adaequatum sive de
condigno</span></span>), and (2) congruous merit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum
inadaequatum sive de congruo</span></span>), so called because
of the congruity, or fitness, that the claim should
be recognized. Condign merit presupposes some
proportion between the work done and the reward
given in compensation for it (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aequalitas s. condignitas
dati et accepti</span></span>). It is measured by commutative
justice and thus confers a real claim to
a reward. For example, a conscientious workman
has a strict claim to his wage. Owing to the
lack of intrinsic proportion between service and
reward, congruous merit can claim a remuneration
only on grounds of fairness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A distinction between these two kinds of
merit was already made by the Fathers, though
not in the terms of present-day theology. It was
known to the older Scholastics and emphasized
anew by Luther's famous adversary Johann Eck.<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No relation of strict justice is conceivable between
the Creator and His creatures. On the
part of God there can only be question of a gratuitous
promise to reward certain good works,—which
promise He is bound to keep because He is
veracious and faithful.<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Two other terms must also be clearly defined
in order to arrive at a true conception of
the gratuity of Christian grace. They are prayer
for grace,<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href="#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> and a capacity or disposition to receive
it.<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a> To pray means to incite God's liberality or
mercy by humble supplication.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) Despite the contrary teaching of Vasquez<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> and a
few other theologians, congruous merit and prayer are
really distinct because one can exist without the other.
As the angels in Heaven are able to pray for us without
earning a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum de
congruo</span></span>, so conversely, all salutary
works are meritorious even without prayer. Moreover,
humble supplication does not involve any positive
service entitled to a reward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another important and obvious distinction,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: between purely natural prayer
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">preces naturae</span></span>)
and supernatural prayer inspired by grace
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">oratio supernaturalis</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Capacity or disposition, especially when it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
takes the form of preparation, may be either positive
or negative. Positive capacity is defined as
<span class="tei tei-q">“that real mode by which a subject, in itself indifferent,
becomes apt to receive a new form.”</span>
Such a capacity or disposition always entails a
claim to its respective form.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Positive capacity or disposition differs from both
prayer or quasi-merit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum
de congruo</span></span>). Quasi-merit
is entitled to a reward on the ground of fairness,
whereas the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">capacitas
s. dispositio positiva</span></span> is at most the
fulfilment of an expectation based upon purely teleological
considerations. Again, a reward can be bestowed
upon some subject other than the one by whom the service
was rendered, whereas the introduction of a new
form necessarily supposes a subject disposed for or
prepared to receive it. Thus only he who is hungry is
disposed for the reception of food and entitled to have his
craving satisfied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Negative capacity consists in the absence or removal
of obstacles that impede the reception of
a new form, as when green wood is dried to
become fit for burning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) There arises the important question whether
or not divine grace is an object of merit, and if
so, to what extent it can be merited by prayer and
preparation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is of faith that the just man, by the performance of
supernaturally good deeds, can merit
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de condigno</span></span> an increase
in the state of grace and eternal glory, and that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the sinner is able to earn justification
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de congruo</span></span>. On
the other hand, it is also an article of faith that divine
grace is strictly gratuitous.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> The two dogmas seem
incompatible, but they are not, as will become evident
if we consider that the good works of the just and the

grace and consequently the merits which they contain

we mean the very first or initial grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia prima

this initial grace the Church explicitly teaches that it is
absolutely incapable of being merited; whence it follows
that all subsequent graces, up to and including
justification, are also gratuitous,<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> unmerited by nature

natural acts.<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> When, at the instance of the bishops

c) The theological argument is based (1) on
the disproportion between nature and grace and
(2) on the absolute necessity of grace for the
performance of salutary works.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no proportion between the natural and the
supernatural, and it would be a contradiction to say
that mere nature can span the chasm separating the two
orders. To assume the existence of a strict <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum
naturae</span></span> for it, would be to deny the gratuity as well as
the supernatural character of grace. To deny these
would be to deny grace itself and with it the whole supernatural
order that forms the groundwork of Christianity.
We know, on the other hand,<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> that grace is absolutely
indispensable for the performance of salutary acts.
Hence, to deny the gratuity of grace would be to credit
nature with the ability to perform salutary acts by its
own power, or at least to merit grace by the performance
of naturally good deeds. In the first hypothesis grace
would no longer be necessary for salvation; in the second,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

therefore no grace at all. Consequently, the gratuity of
grace cannot be consistently denied without at the same
time denying its necessity.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a>

a) The Scriptural argument given above for thesis I
also covers this thesis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Semipelagians quoted Matth. XXV, 15 in support
of their teaching: <span class="tei tei-q">“To one he gave five talents, and to
another two, and to another one, to every one according
to his proper ability.”</span><a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> But this text is too vague
to serve as an argument in such an important matter.
Not a few exegetes treat it as a kind of rhetorical figure.
Others, following the example of the Fathers, take <span class="tei tei-q">“talents”</span>
to mean purely natural gifts, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratiae gratis
datae</span></span>, while by <span class="tei tei-q">“ability”</span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtus</span></span>) they understand the
already existing grace of faith or a certain definite measure
of initial grace.<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a> But even if <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtus</span></span>
meant natural faculty or talent, it cannot be identical with <span class="tei tei-q">“merit.”</span>
Considering the common teaching of theologians that the
angels were endowed with grace according to the measure
of their natural perfection,<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> we may well suppose
that man receives grace likewise according to his natural
constitution (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sequitur naturam</span></span>)—a
predisposition or aptitude which God ordained in His infinite wisdom
to be the instrument through which His graces should
operate either for personal sanctification or the good of
others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) St. Augustine and his disciples, in defending
the orthodox faith against the Semipelagians,
strongly insisted on the gratuity of the grace of
faith, and above all of the initial

α) St. Augustine comments on 1 Cor. IV, 7 as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing is so opposed to this feeling as for
any one to glory concerning his own merits in such a
way as if he himself had made them for himself, and
not the grace of God,—a grace, however, which makes
the good to differ from the wicked, and is not common
to the good and the wicked.”</span><a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> And in another place
he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“For it would not in any sense be the grace of God, were
it not in every sense gratuitous.”</span><a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a>

β) Certain of the Greek Fathers have been suspected
of Semipelagian leanings because they appear to assign
the chief rôle in the business of salvation to nature.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a>
A careful study of their writings, however, shows
that these authors had in mind co-operating, not prevenient
grace. The general teaching of the Orientals on
the gratuity of grace is sufficiently indicated by the demand
made at the Council of Lydda (A. D. 415), that
Pelagius be compelled to retract the proposition:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Gratiam
Dei secundum merita nostra dari.</span></span>”</span> The Fathers
who have been accused of Semipelagian sympathies
merely wished to emphasize free-will and to incite the
morally indifferent to co-operate heartily with divine
grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Chrysostom, in particular, expressly asserts the
absolute gratuity of grace when he says of faith:
<span class="tei tei-q">“That which is a merit of faith, may not be ascribed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to us, for it is a free gift of God,”</span><a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> and directly contradicts
Cassian and the Massilians when he declares:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast it not of thyself, thou hast received it from
God. Hence thou hast received whatever thou hast, not
only this or that, but all thou hast. For it is not thine
own merit, but the grace of God. Although thou allegest the
faith, thou hast received it by vocation.”</span><a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The theological argument for our thesis may be
succinctly stated thus: The grace of God is the cause
of our merits, and hence cannot be itself merited. Being
the cause, it cannot be an effect.<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a>

but to a positive divine decree to grant supernatural
prayer.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Second Council of Orange defined against
the Semipelagians: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one says that the
grace of God can be obtained by human [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> natural]
prayer, and that it is not grace itself which

a) Sacred Scripture teaches that, unless we are
inspired by the Holy Ghost, we cannot pray efficaciously.
It follows that to be efficacious,
prayer must be an effect of prevenient grace.
We should not even know for what or how to
pray, if the Holy Ghost did not inspire us. Cfr.
Rom. VIII, 26: <span class="tei tei-q">“For we know not what we
should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself

b) This is also the teaching of the Fathers.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who would truly groan, desiring to receive what he prays

that this is also itself the gift of God, that with a
true heart and spiritually we cry to God. Let
them, therefore, observe how they are mistaken
who think that our seeking, asking, knocking is
of ourselves, and is not given to us; and say that
this is the case because grace is preceded by our
merits; that it follows them when we ask and receive,
and seek and find, and it is opened to us
when we knock.”</span><a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a>

c) From the theological point of view the inefficacy
of purely natural prayer in matters pertaining
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to salvation can be demonstrated thus:
Revelation tells us that the work of salvation requires
for its beginning an initial supernatural
grace. Now prayer, that is to say, efficacious
prayer, is in itself a salutary act. Consequently,
there can be no efficacious prayer without prevenient
grace, and purely natural prayer is inefficacious
for salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ripalda holds that, in an economy different from the
present, natural prayer would have a claim to be heard.
This opinion can be defended without prejudice to the
dogma of the gratuity of grace. No doubt God might
condescend to hear such petitions if He would, though,
of course, He is not bound to do so by any intrinsic
power inherent in natural prayer. Unlike merit, prayer
appeals to the mercy of God, not to His justice. Ripalda's
theory, however, rests upon an unprovable assumption,
namely, that man in the state of pure nature
would be able to know of the existence, or at least the
possibility, of a supernatural order and to strive for the
beatific vision as his final end.<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a>

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">propositio certa</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. Positive preparation or disposition for
grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">capacitas
sive praeparatio positiva</span></span>) is practically
on a level with natural prayer. The positive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disposition for a natural good sometimes includes
a certain demand to satisfaction, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
thirst demands to be quenched. This is still more
the case when the disposition has been acquired by
a positive preparation for the good in question.
Thus a student, by conscientiously preparing himself
for examination, acquires a claim to be admitted
to it sooner or later. Can this also
be said of grace? Does there exist in man a
positive disposition for grace in the sense that
the withholding of it would grievously injure and
disappoint the soul? Can man, without supernatural
aid, positively dispose himself for the reception
of supernatural grace, confident that God
will reward his efforts by bestowing it on him?
Both these questions must be answered in the negative.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) If there were something in the natural make-up of
man which would move the Almighty to give him grace,
the bestowal of grace would no longer be a free act of
God. But to assert the consequent would be Semipelagian,
hence the antecedent must be false.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) This truth can easily be deduced from the teaching
of the Fathers in the Semipelagian controversy.
They declare, in perfect conformity with St. Paul, that
grace is bestowed gratuitously because God can give or
withhold it as He pleases. St. Augustine says<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a> that the
grace of Baptism is granted freely, that is, without regard
to any positive disposition on the part of the baptized
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
infant. It should be remembered, moreover, that
nature never existed in its pure form, and is now tainted
by original sin.<a id="noteref_452" name="noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">452</span></span></a> Surely a nature tainted by sin cannot
possibly possess the power of meriting divine grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The contention of the so-called Augustinians, that
pure nature needs actual grace to save itself, and consequently
has a claim to such grace at least <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex decentia
Creatoris</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex
lege iustissimae providentiae</span></span>, perilously
resembles Baius' condemned proposition that the state of
pure nature is impossible.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Thesis V: Man may prepare himself negatively for
the reception of supernatural grace by not putting any
obstacles in its way.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This proposition is held by a majority of Catholic
theologians (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sententia communior</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. The solution of this question is intimately
connected with the famous Scholastic
axiom: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Facienti quod est in se Deus non denegat
gratiam</span></span>,”</span> that is, to the man who does what
he can, God does not refuse grace. This axiom
is susceptible of three different interpretations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) It may mean: <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Facienti quod est in se cum
auxilio gratiae Deus confert ulteriorem gratiam</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to him who does what he can with the help of
supernatural grace, God grants further and more
powerful graces up to justification. This is
merely another way of stating the indisputable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
truth that, by faithfully coöperating with the
grace of God, man is able to merit additional
graces, and it holds true even of infidels and
sinners. The first freely performed salutary
act establishes a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum de congruo</span></span> towards
other acts disposing a man for justification. And
since the first as well as all subsequent salutary
acts, in this hypothesis, are pure graces, this interpretation
of our axiom is entirely compatible
with the dogma of the gratuity of grace.<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Facienti quod est in se ex viribus naturalibus
Deus non denegat gratiam</span></span> (to him who
does what he can with his natural moral
strength, God does not refuse grace.) This does
not mean that, in consequence of the efforts of
the natural will, God may not withhold from
anyone the first grace of vocation. In this sense
the axiom would be Semipelagian, and has been
rejected by a majority of the Schoolmen. It is
said of Molina that he tried to render it acceptable
by the hypothesis that God bound Himself by a
contract with Christ to give His grace to all men
who would make good use of their natural faculties.
But how could the existence of this imaginary
contract be proved? In matter of fact Molina
taught, with a large number of other divines,<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a>
that God in the bestowal of His graces freely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bound Himself to a definite rule, which coincides
with His universal will to save all mankind.
In the application of this law He pays no regard
to any positive disposition or preparation,
but merely to the presence or absence of obstacles
which would prove impediments to grace. In
other words, God, generally speaking, is more inclined
to offer His grace to one who puts no
obstacles in its way than to one who wallows in
sin and neglects to do his share.<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Facienti quod est in se ex viribus naturae
negative se disponendo [i.e. obicem non ponendo]
Deus non denegat gratiam</span></span> (to the man
who does what he can with his natural moral
strength, disposing himself negatively [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, by
not placing any obstacle] God does not deny grace.
In this form the axiom is identical with our thesis.
The question arises: Can it be made to square
with the dogma of the absolute gratuity of grace?
Vasquez,<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a> Glossner,<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> and some others answer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this question in the negative, whereas the great
majority of Catholic theologians hold with
Suarez<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>
and Lessius,<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a> that there is no contradiction
between the two. Though Lessius did
not succeed in proving his famous contention that
the axiom <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Facienti quod est in se Deus non denegat
gratiam</span></span>, was for three full centuries understood
in this sense by the schools,<a id="noteref_461" name="noteref_461" href="#note_461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a> there is no
doubt that many authorities can be cited in favor
of his interpretation.<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The theological argument for our thesis may
be formulated thus: The gratuity of grace does
not imply that the recipient must have no sort of
disposition. It merely means that man is positively
unworthy of divine favor. Otherwise the
Church could not teach, as she does, that the
grace bestowed on the angels and on our first
parents in Paradise was absolutely gratuitous,
nor could she hold that the Hypostatic Union of
the two natures in Christ, which is the pattern
and exemplar of all true grace,<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href="#note_463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a> was a pure grace
in respect of the humanity of our Lord. The
dogma of the gratuity of grace is in no danger
whatever so long as the relation between
negative disposition and supernatural grace is
conceived as actual (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">facienti=qui facit</span></span>),
not causal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">facienti=quia facit</span></span>). The motive for the
distribution of grace is to be sought not in the
dignity of human nature, but in God's will to save
all men. We must, however, guard against the
erroneous notion that grace is bestowed according
to a fixed law or an infallible norm regulating
the amount of grace in accordance with the condition
of the recipient. Sometimes great sinners
are miraculously converted, while others of
fairly good antecedents perish. Yet, again, who
could say that to the omniscient and all-wise God
the great sinner did not appear better fitted to
receive grace than the <span class="tei tei-q">“decent”</span> but self-sufficient
pharisee?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The gratuity of grace does not conflict with
its universality. Though God distributes His
graces freely, He grants them to all men without
exception, because He wills all to be saved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This divine <span class="tei tei-q">“will to save”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas Dei
salvifica</span></span>) may be regarded in relation either to the wayfaring state
or to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">status termini</span></span>. Regarded
from the first-mentioned point of view it is a merciful will
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas misericordiae</span></span>)
and is generally called first or antecedent will
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas prima s. antecedens</span></span>) or
God's salvific will
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas Dei salvifica</span></span>)
in the strict sense of the word. Considered in relation to the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">status termini</span></span>, it is a just
will, as God rewards or punishes each creature according
to its deserts. This second or consequent will (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas
secunda s. consequens</span></span>) is called <span class="tei tei-q">“predestination”</span> in so
far as it rewards the just, and <span class="tei tei-q">“reprobation”</span> in so far as
it punishes the wicked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God's <span class="tei tei-q">“will to save”</span> may therefore be defined as an
earnest and sincere desire to justify all men and make
them supernaturally happy. As
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas antecedens</span></span> it is
conditional, depending on the free co-operation of man;
as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas
consequens</span></span>, on the other hand, it is absolute,
because God owes it to His justice to reward or punish
every man according to his deserts.<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464" href="#note_464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a>

a difference in the Scriptural proofs by which either is

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. Its chief opponents are the Calvinists
and the Jansenists, who heretically maintain that
God wills to save none but the predestined.
Against Calvin the Tridentine Council defined:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If any one saith that the grace of justification
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

unto life, but that all others who are called, are

the divine power, predestined unto evil; let him

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The teaching of Jansenius that Christ died exclusively
for the predestined,<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a> was censured as
<span class="tei tei-q">“heretical”</span> by Pope Innocent X. Hence it
is of faith that Christ died for others besides the
predestined. Who are these <span class="tei tei-q">“others”</span>? As the
Church obliges all her children to pray: <span class="tei tei-q">“[Christ]

it is certain that at least all the faithful
are included in the saving will of God. We
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“at least all the faithful,”</span> because in matter
of fact the divine <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas

the descendants of Adam, as we shall show
further on.<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Holy Scripture positively declares in a
number of passages that God wills the salvation
of all believers, whether predestined or not.
Jesus Himself says in regard to the Jews:
Matth. XXIII, 37: <span class="tei tei-q">“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou
that killest the prophets, and stonest them that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are sent unto thee, how often would I (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">volui</span></span>)
have gathered together thy children, as the hen
doth gather her chickens under her wings, and
thou wouldst not (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">noluisti</span></span>).”</span> Two facts are
stated in this text: (1) Our Lord's earnest desire
to save the Jewish people, anciently through the
instrumentality of the prophets, and now in His
own person; (2) the refusal of the Jews to be
saved. Of those who believe in Christ under the
New Covenant we read in the Gospel of St. John
(III, 16): <span class="tei tei-q">“God so loved the world, as to give
his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth
in him<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href="#note_470"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">470</span></span></a>
may not perish, but may have life everlasting.”</span>
However, since many who believe in
Christ do actually perish,<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href="#note_471"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a>
the divine <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas
salvifica</span></span>, in principle, extends not only to the predestined,
but to all the faithful, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> to all who
have received the sacrament of Baptism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The teaching of the Fathers can be
gathered from the quotations given under Thesis
II, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infra</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The theological argument may be briefly summarized
as follows: God's will to save is co-extensive with
the grace of adoptive sonship
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">filiatio adoptiva</span></span>), which
is imparted either by Baptism or by perfect charity.
Now, some who were once in the state of grace are
eternally lost. Consequently, God also wills the salvation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of those among the faithful who do not actually attain

to two classical passages, Wisd. XI, 24 sq.
and 1 Tim. II, 1 sqq.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The Book of Wisdom, after extolling God's
omnipotence, says of His mercy: <span class="tei tei-q">“But thou hast
mercy upon all, because thou canst do all things,
and overlookest the sins of men for the sake of
repentance. For thou lovest all things that are,
and hatest none of the things which thou hast
made.... Thou sparest all, because they are
thine, O Lord, who lovest souls.”</span><a id="noteref_472" name="noteref_472" href="#note_472"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">472</span></span></a>

In this text the mercy of God is described as universal.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Misereris omnium,
parcis omnibus</span></span>. This universality
is based (1) on His omnipotence (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quia
omnia potes</span></span>),
which is unlimited. His mercy, being equally boundless,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
must therefore include all men without exception.
The universality of God's mercy is based (2) on His
universal over-lordship and dominion (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">quoniam tua sunt;
diligis omnia quae fecisti</span></span>). As there is no creature that
does not belong to God, so there is no man whom He
does not love and to whom He does not show mercy.
The universality of God's mercy in the passage quoted is
based (3) on His love for souls
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qui amas animas</span></span>).
Wherever there is an immortal soul (be it in child or
adult, Christian, pagan or Jew), God is at work to save it.
Consequently the divine
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span> is universal, not
only in a moral, but in the physical sense of the term,
that is, it embraces all the descendants of Adam.

that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings
be made for all men.... For this is good and acceptable

all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of

The question arises: Is the universality of the divine

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas
salvifica</span></span>, as inculcated by St. Paul, merely moral,
or is it physical, admitting of no exceptions? The
answer may be found in the threefold reason given
by the Apostle: the oneness of God, the mediatorship
of Christ, and the universality of the Redemption. (1) <span class="tei tei-q">“For
there is [but] one God.”</span><a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a> As truly, therefore,

of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”</span> The human
nature which Christ assumed in the Incarnation is common
to all men. Hence, whoever is a man, has Jesus
Christ for his mediator.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a> (3) Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“gave himself a

will to save is co-extensive with His will to redeem. The
latter is universal,<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a>

b) The Fathers and early ecclesiastical writers
were wont to base their teaching in this matter

α) We must limit ourselves to a few specimen citations.
St. Ambrose declares that God wills to save
all men. <span class="tei tei-q">“He willed all to be His own whom He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Gregory of Nazianzus holds God's
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span> to
be co-extensive in scope with original sin and the atonement.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The law, the prophets, and the sufferings of
Christ,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“by which we were redeemed, are common
property and admit of no exception: but as all [men]

since all men are in duty bound to pray for their fellowmen,
God must needs be willing to save all without exception.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We must sincerely believe,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“that God
wills all men to be saved, since the Apostle solicitously prescribes supplication

question why so many perish, Prosper answers as
follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“[God] wills all to be saved and to come to
the knowledge of truth, ... so that those who are saved,
are saved because He wills them to be saved, while those who perish,
perish because they deserve to perish.”</span><a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a>
In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Responsiones ad Capitula Obiectionum Vincentianarum</span></span>
the same writer energetically defends St.
Augustine against the accusation that his teaching on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
predestination is incompatible with the orthodox doctrine
of the universality of God's saving will.<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href="#note_483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) St. Augustine aroused suspicion in the camp of
the Semipelagians by his general teaching on predestination
and more particularly by his interpretation of
1 Tim. II, 4. The great Bishop of Hippo interprets this
Pauline text in no less than four different ways. In
his treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Spiritu et Litera</span></span> he describes the divine
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span>
as strictly universal in the physical sense.<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enchiridion</span></span>
he restricts it to the predestined.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a> In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contra Iulianum</span></span> he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“No one
is saved unless God so wills.”</span><a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a>
In his work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Correptione
et Gratia</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“God wills all men to be saved, because
He makes us to will this, just as He sent the spirit
of His Son [into our hearts], crying: Abba, Father, that
is, making us to cry, Abba, Father.”</span><a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> How did St.
Augustine come to interpret this simple text in so many
different ways? Some think he chose this method to
overwhelm the Pelagians and Semipelagians with Scriptural
proofs. But this polemical motive can hardly have
induced him to becloud an obvious text and invent interpretations
which never occurred to any other ecclesiastical
writer before or after his time. The conundrum can
only be solved by the assumption that Augustine believed
in a plurality of literal senses in the Bible and held that
over and above (or notwithstanding) the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus obvius</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every exegete is free to read as much truth into any given
passage as possible, and that such interpretation lay within
the scope of the inspiration of the Holy Ghost quite
as much as the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus obvius</span></span>. In his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Confessions</span></span><a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a> he
actually argues in favor of a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pluralitas sensuum</span></span>. He
was keen enough to perceive, however, that if a Scriptural
text is interpreted in different ways, the several constructions
put upon it must not be contradictory. As he
was undoubtedly aware of the distinction between
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas antecedens</span></span>
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consequens</span></span>,<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> his different interpretations
of 1 Tim. II, 4 can be reconciled by assuming
that he conceived God's <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span> as
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">antecedens</span></span>
in so far as it is universal, and as
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consequens</span></span>
in so far as it is particular. St. Thomas solves the difficulty
in a similar manner: <span class="tei tei-q">“The words of the Apostle,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘God will have all men to be saved, etc.,’</span> can be understood
in three ways: First, by a restricted application,
in which case they would mean, as Augustine says,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘God wills all men to be saved that are saved, not because
there is no man whom he does not wish to be
saved, but because there is no man saved whose salvation
He does not will.’</span> Secondly, they can be understood as
applying to every class of individuals, not of every individual
of each class; in which case they mean that <span class="tei tei-q">‘God
wills some men of every class and condition to be saved,
males and females, Jews and Gentiles, great and small, but
not all of every condition.’</span> Thirdly, according to the
Damascene, they are understood of the antecedent will of
God, not of the consequent will. The distinction must
not be taken as applying to the divine will itself, in which
there is nothing antecedent or consequent; but to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
things willed. To understand which we must consider
that everything, so far as it is good, is willed by God.
A thing taken in its strict sense, and considered absolutely,
may be good or evil, and yet when some additional circumstance
is taken into account, by a consequent consideration
may be changed into its contrary. Thus, that
men should live is good; and that men should be killed
is evil, absolutely considered. If in a particular case it
happens that a man is a murderer or dangerous to society,
to kill him becomes good, to let him live an evil. Hence
it may be said of a just judge that antecedently he wills
all men to live, but consequently he wills the murderer to
be hanged. In the same way God antecedently wills all
men to be saved, but consequently wills some to be
damned, as His justice exacts. Nor do we will simply
what we will antecedently, but rather we will it in a
qualified manner; for the will is directed to things as they
are in themselves, and in themselves they exist under
particular qualifications. Hence we will a thing simply
in as much as we will it when all particular circumstances
are considered; and this is what is meant by willing consequently.
Thus it may be said that a just judge wills
simply the hanging of a murderer, but in a qualified manner
he would will him to live, inasmuch as he is a man.
Such a qualified will may be called a willingness rather
than an absolute will. Thus it is clear that whatever
God simply wills takes place; although what He wills
antecedently may not take place.”</span><a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Thesis III: The lot of unbaptized infants, though
difficult to reconcile with the universality of God's saving
will, furnishes no argument against it.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. The most difficult problem concerning
the divine <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span>—a real
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">crux theologorum</span></span>—is
the fate of unbaptized children. The
Church has never uttered a dogmatic definition
on this head, and theologians hold widely divergent
opinions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bellarmine teaches that infants who die without
being baptized, are excluded from the divine
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span>,
because, while the non-reception
of Baptism is the proximate reason of their
damnation, its ultimate reason must be the will
of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) This rather incautious assertion needs to be
carefully restricted. It is an article of faith that
God has instituted the sacrament of Baptism as
the ordinary means of salvation for all men. On
the other hand, it is certain that He expects
parents, priests, and relatives, as his representatives,
to provide conscientiously for its proper and
timely administration. Sinful negligence on the
part of these responsible agents cannot, therefore,
be charged to Divine Providence, but must be laid
at the door of those human agents who fail to do
their duty. In exceptional cases infants can be
saved even by means of the so-called Baptism of
blood (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">baptismus sanguinis</span></span>),
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> death for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christ's sake. On the whole it may be said that
God has, in principle, provided for the salvation of
little children by the institution of infant Baptism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) But there are many cases in which either invincible
ignorance or the order of nature precludes the administration
of Baptism. The well-meant opinion of
some theologians<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a> that the responsibility in all such cases
lies not with God, but with men, lacks probability. Does
God, then, really will the damnation of these innocents?
Some modern writers hold that the physical order of
nature is responsible for the misfortune of so many
innocent infants; but this hypothesis contributes nothing
towards clearing up the awful mystery.<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a> For God is
the author of the natural as well as of the supernatural
order. To say that He is obliged to remove existing
obstacles by means of a miracle would disparage His
ordinary providence.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a> Klee's assumption that dying
children become conscious long enough to enable them
to receive the Baptism of desire
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">baptismus flaminis</span></span>),
is scarcely compatible with the definition of the Council
of Florence that <span class="tei tei-q">“the souls of those who die in actual
mortal sin, or only in original sin, forthwith descend to
hell.”</span><a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> A still more unsatisfactory supposition is that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the prayer of Christian parents acts like a baptism of desire
and saves their children from hell. This theory, espoused
by Cardinal Cajetan, was rejected by the Fathers
of Trent,<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a> and Pope Pius V ordered it to be expunged

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A way out of the difficulty is suggested by Gutberlet and
others, who, holding with St. Thomas that infants that
die without Baptism will enjoy a kind of natural beatitude,
think it possible that God, in view of their sufferings,
may mercifully cleanse them from original sin and
thereby place them in a state of innocence.<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href="#note_497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> This theory
is based on the assumption that the ultimate fate
of unbaptized children is deprivation of the beatific
vision of God and therefore a state of real damnation
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">poena damni, infernum</span></span>),
and that the remission of original
sin has for its object merely to enable these unfortunate
infants to enjoy a perfect natural beatitude,
which they could not otherwise attain. It is reasonable
to argue that, as these infants are deprived of celestial
happiness through no guilt of their own, the Creator can
hardly deny them some sort of natural beatitude, to
which their very nature seems to entitle them. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hell”</span>
for them probably consists in being deprived of the beatific
vision of God, which is a supernatural grace and as such
lies outside the sphere of those prerogatives to which human
nature has a claim by the fact of creation. This
theory would seem to establish at least some manner of
salvation for the infants in question, and consequently,
to vindicate the divine <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span>
in the same measure. Needless to say, it can claim no more than probability,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and we find ourselves constrained to admit, at the
conclusion of our survey, that there is no sure and perfect
solution of the difficulty, and theologians therefore
do well to confess their ignorance.<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The difficulty of which we have spoken does
not, of course, in any way impair the certainty
of the dogma. The Scriptural passages cited
above<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a> clearly prove that God wills to save
all men without exception. In basing the universality
of God's mercy on His omnipotence, His
universal dominion, and His love of souls, the
Book of Wisdom<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> evidently implies that the unbaptized
infants participate in that mercy in all
three of these respects. How indeed could Divine
Omnipotence exert itself more effectively
than by conferring grace on those who are inevitably
and without any fault of their own deprived
of Baptism? Who would deny that little
children, as creatures, are subject to God's universal
dominion in precisely the same manner as
adults? Again, if God loves the souls of men,
must He not also love the souls of infants?

1 Tim. II, 4<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a> applies primarily to adults,

Christ as God-man is the <span class="tei tei-q">“one mediator of God
and men,”</span> He must also have assumed the human
nature of children, in order to redeem them from
original sin. Again, if Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“gave himself a

millions of infants should be directly excluded
from the benefits of the atonement.<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a>

This dogma is clearly contained in Holy Scripture.
We shall quote the most important texts.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) 1 John V, 3 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“For this is the charity
of God, that we keep his commandments, and his
commandments are not heavy. For whatsoever
is born of God, overcometh the world.”</span><a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href="#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> According
to this text the <span class="tei tei-q">“charity of God”</span> manifests
itself in <span class="tei tei-q">“keeping his commandments”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“overcoming the world.”</span> This is declared to be
an easy task. Our Lord Himself says: <span class="tei tei-q">“My
yoke is sweet and my burden light.”</span><a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> Hence
it must be possible to keep His commandments,
and therefore God does not withhold the absolutely
necessary graces from the just.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Paul consoles the Corinthians by telling
them that God will not suffer them to be tempted
beyond their strength, but will help them to a
happy issue, provided they faithfully coöperate
with His grace. 1 Cor. X, 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“God is faithful,
who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
which you are able, but will make also with temptation
issue, that you may be able to bear it.”</span><a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a>
As it is impossible even for the just to overcome
grievous temptations without supernatural aid,<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href="#note_510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a>
and as God Himself tells us that we are able to
overcome them, it is a necessary inference that He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bestows sufficient grace. The context hardly
leaves a doubt that St. Paul has in mind the just,
for a few lines further up he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore he
that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed
lest he fall.”</span><a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) This dogma is clearly set forth in the writings
of the Fathers. Some of them, it is true,
when combating the Pelagians and Semipelagians,
defended the proposition that <span class="tei tei-q">“grace is not given
to all men,”</span><a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> but

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) A typical representative of this group of ecclesiastical
writers is the anonymous author of the work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De

praised as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">probatus
Ecclesiae magister</span></span>.”</span> This fifth-century
writer, who was highly esteemed by his contemporaries,
discusses the question whether and in what sense
all men are called, and why some are not saved. He
begins by drawing a distinction between God's general and
His special providence.<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“It so pleased God,”</span> he says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“to give His efficacious grace to many, and to withhold

denied to the entire race.”</span><a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href="#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) The Jansenists appealed in favor of their teaching
to such Patristic passages as the following: <span class="tei tei-q">“After
the withdrawal of the divine assistance he [St. Peter]
was unable to stand;”</span><a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517" href="#note_517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> and: <span class="tei tei-q">“He had undertaken more
than he was able to do.”</span><a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a>
But the two Fathers from
whose writings these passages are taken (SS. Chrysostom
and Augustine) speak, as the context evinces, of
the withdrawal of efficacious and proximately sufficient
grace in punishment of Peter's presumption. Had St.
Peter followed our Lord's advice<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a> and prayed instead
of relying on his own strength, he would not have
fallen. That this was the mind of St. Augustine clearly
appears from the following sentence in his work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Unitate
Ecclesiae</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who shall doubt that Judas, had he
willed, would not have betrayed Christ, and that
Peter, had he willed, would not have thrice denied his
Master?”</span><a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The theological argument for our thesis
may be formulated as follows: Since the state
of grace confers a claim to supernatural happiness,
it must also confer a claim to those graces
which are necessary to attain it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To assert that God denies the just sufficient grace
to observe His commandments, to avoid mortal sin, and
to persevere in the state of grace, would be to gainsay
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
His solemn promise to His adopted children: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is
the will of my Father that sent me: that every one who
seeth the Son and believeth in him, may have life everlasting,
and I will raise him up in the last day.”</span><a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> Consequently,
God owes it to His own fidelity to bestow sufficient
graces upon the just.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, according to the plain teaching of Revelation,
the just are obliged, under pain of sin, to observe the
commandments of God and the precepts of His
Church.<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a> But this is impossible without the aid of
grace. Consequently, God grants at least sufficient
grace to his servants, for <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first part of this thesis embodies a theological
conclusion; the second states the common
teaching of Catholic theologians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proof of the First Part.</span></span> The distinction
here drawn between <span class="tei tei-q">“ordinary”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“obdurate”</span>
sinners has its basis in revelation and is clearly
demanded by the different degrees of certainty
attaching to the two parts of our thesis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An <span class="tei tei-q">“ordinary”</span> sinner is a Christian who has lost sanctifying
grace by a grievous sin. An <span class="tei tei-q">“obdurate”</span> sinner
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is one who, by repeatedly and maliciously transgressing
the laws of God, has dulled his intellect and hardened his
will against salutary inspirations. A man may be an
habitual sinner (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consuetudinarius</span></span>)
and a backslider, without
being obdurate, or, which comes to the same, impenitent.
Weakness is not malice, though sinful habits often
beget impenitence, which is one of the sins against the
Holy Ghost and the most formidable obstacle in the way
of conversion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to ordinary sinners, our thesis
asserts that they always receive sufficient grace
to avoid mortal sin and do penance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Experience teaches that a man falls deeper
and deeper if he does not hasten to do penance
after committing a mortal sin. But this is not
the fault of Almighty God, who never withholds
His grace; it is wholly the fault of the sinner who
fails to coöperate with the proffered supernatural
assistance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) A sufficient Scriptural argument for this
part of our thesis is contained in the texts cited in
support of Thesis I. If it is true that God suffers
no one to be tempted beyond his strength,<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a>
this must surely apply to Christians who have had
the misfortune of committing mortal sin. St.
John says that the commandments of God <span class="tei tei-q">“are
not heavy”</span> and that faith is <span class="tei tei-q">“the victory which
overcometh the world.”</span><a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> Faith in Christ remains
in the Christian, even though he be guilty
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of mortal sin, and consequently if he wills, he is
able, by the aid of sufficient grace, to overcome
the <span class="tei tei-q">“world,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the temptations arising from
concupiscence,<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a> and thus to cease committing
mortal sins.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) As for the teaching of Tradition, St. Augustine
lays down two theological principles
which apply to saint and sinner alike.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“God does not enjoin impossibilities,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“but in
His injunctions counsels you both to do what you can for yourself, and
to ask His aid in what you cannot do.”</span><a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a>
It follows that the sinner always receives at least the grace
of prayer, which Augustine therefore calls
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia initialis
sive parva</span></span>, and of which he says that its right use ensures
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia magna</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second principle is this: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Cum lege coniuncta
est gratia, quâ lex observari possit.</span></span>”</span> That is, every
divine law, by special ordinance, carries with it the grace
by which it may be observed. In other words, the laws
of God can always be obeyed because the lawgiver never
fails to grant sufficient grace to keep them.<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) That the sinner always receives sufficient
grace to be converted, follows from the Scriptural
injunction of conversion. If conversion to
God is a duty, and to comply with this duty is
impossible without the aid of grace,<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a> the divine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
command obviously implies the bestowal of sufficient
grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That conversion is a duty follows from such Scriptural
texts as these: <span class="tei tei-q">“As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire
not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn
from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your
evil ways!”</span><a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord delayeth not his promise, as
some imagine, but dealeth patiently for your sake, not
willing that any should perish, but that all should return
to penance.”</span><a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This teaching is faithfully echoed by Tradition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proof of the Second Part.</span></span> Obduracy is a
serious obstacle to conversion because the obdurate
sinner has confirmed his will in malice<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a>
and by systematic resistance diminished the influence
of grace. The question here is whether
or not God in such cases eventually withdraws His
grace altogether.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some rigorists hold that He does so, with the purpose
of sparing the sinner greater tortures in hell.<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a> Though
this assertion cannot be said to contravene the dogma of
the universality of God's salvific will, (its defenders do
not deny that He faithfully does His share to save these
unfortunate reprobates), we prefer to adopt the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sententia
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
communis</span></span>, that God grants even the most obdurate sinner—at
least now and then, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> during a mission or on
the occasion of some terrible catastrophe—sufficient
grace to be converted. The theological reasons for this
opinion, which we hold to be the true one, coincide in
their last analysis with those set forth in the first part
of our thesis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Sacred Scripture, in speaking of the duty of
repentance, makes no distinction between ordinary
and obdurate sinners. On the contrary, the Book
of Wisdom points to one of the most wicked
and impenitent of nations, the Canaanites, as a
shining object of divine mercy and patience.<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href="#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>
According to St. Paul, God calls especially upon
hardened and impenitent sinners to do penance.
Rom. II, 4 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Or despisest thou the riches
of his goodness, and patience, and long suffering?
Knowest thou not that the benignity of God leadeth
thee to penance? But according to thy hardness
and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to
thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation
of the just judgment of God, who will render
to every man according to his works.”</span><a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are some Scriptural passages which seem to
imply that God withdraws His grace from those who are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obdurate, nay, that He Himself hardens their hearts in
punishment of sin. Thus the Lord says of Pharao: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
shall harden his heart,”</span><a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a> and Moses tells us: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he harkened not unto
them.”</span><a id="noteref_537" name="noteref_537" href="#note_537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a> But it would be wrong to assume that
this denotes a positive action on the part of God. Pharao, as
we are told further on, <span class="tei tei-q">“hardened his own heart”</span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ingravavit
cor suum</span></span>).<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a>
The fault in all cases lies with the
sinner, who obstinately resists the call of grace. God's
co-operation in the matter is merely indirect. The
greater and stronger graces which He grants to ordinary
sinners, He withholds from the obdurate in punishment
of their malice. This is, however, by no means tantamount
to a withdrawal of sufficient grace.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href="#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a>

b) The Fathers speak of God's way of dealing
with obdurate sinners in a manner which clearly
shows their belief that He never entirely withdraws
His mercy. They insist that the light
of grace is never extinguished in the present
life. <span class="tei tei-q">“God gave them over to a reprobate
mind,”</span> says St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“for such is the blindness
of the mind. Whosoever is given over
thereunto, is shut out from the interior light of
God: but not wholly as yet, whilst he is in this
life. For there is <span class="tei tei-q">‘outer darkness,’</span> which is understood
to belong rather to the day of judgment;
that he should rather be wholly without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It follows that no sinner, how desperate soever
his case may appear, need be despaired of. As
long as there is life there is hope.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> The Fathers
consistently teach that the reason why reprobates
are lost is not lack of grace but their own
malice. Thus St. Chrysostom comments on
Isaias' prophecy regarding the impenitence of the
Jews: <span class="tei tei-q">“The reason they did not believe was
not that Isaias had predicted their unbelief, but
his prediction was based on the fact that they
would not believe. They were unable to believe, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
they had not the will to believe.”</span><a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The theological argument for our thesis is well
stated by St. Thomas. He distinguishes between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">obstinatio
perfecta</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">obstinatio imperfecta</span></span>
and says: Perfect obstinacy exists only in hell. Imperfect obstinacy
is that of a sinner who has his will so firmly set on evil
that he is incapable of any but the faintest impulses towards
virtue, though even these are sufficient to prepare
the way for grace.<a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“If any one falls into sin after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
having received Baptism,”</span> says the Fourth Lateran Council, <span class="tei tei-q">“he can
always be restored by sincere penance.”</span><a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a>
As the power of the keys comprises all sins, even those
against the Holy Ghost, so divine grace is held out to all
sinners. The Montanistic doctrine of the unforgivableness
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“three capital sins”</span> (apostasy, murder, and
adultery) was already condemned as heretical during the
life-time of Tertullian. The sinner can obtain forgiveness
only by receiving the sacrament of Penance or making an
act of perfect contrition.<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> Justly, therefore, does the
Church regard despair of God's mercy as an additional
grievous sin. If the rigorists were right in asserting
that God in the end absolutely abandons the sinner, there
could be no hope of forgiveness, and despair would be
justified.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The Biblical argument for our thesis is
based on the dogma that God wills all men to be
saved. 1 Tim. II, 4: <span class="tei tei-q">“[God] will have all men
to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the
truth [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the true faith].”</span> In speaking of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“day of wrath,”</span> St. Paul emphasizes the fact that
the Almighty Judge <span class="tei tei-q">“will render to every man according

wrath and damnation to the wicked.<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a> And he

also to the Greek; for there is no respect of persons

synonymous with gentile or heathen. It follows
that the heathens are able to perform supernatural
salutary acts with the aid of grace, and
that they will receive the reward of eternal beatitude
if they lead a good life.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the uncivilized tribes may be applied what has been
said regarding the fate of unbaptized infants. The real
problem is: How does the merciful Creator provide for
those who are sufficiently intelligent to be able to
speculate on God, the soul, the future destiny of man,
etc.? Holy Scripture teaches: <span class="tei tei-q">“Without faith it is
impossible to please God, for he that cometh to

to the existence of God, immortality, and retribution
would not be sufficient for salvation, even if elevated to the

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
evident from the condemnation, by Pope Innocent XI, of
the proposition that <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith in a wide sense, based on the
testimony of the created universe, or some other similar motive, is sufficient unto
justification.”</span><a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> The only sort
of faith that results in justification, according to the Vatican
Council, is <span class="tei tei-q">“a supernatural virtue, whereby, inspired
and assisted by the grace of God, we believe that the
things which He has revealed are true; not because of the
intrinsic truth of the things, viewed by the natural light

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Catechism demands of every one who desires to
be saved that he have a supernatural belief in six distinct
truths: the existence of God, retribution in the next
world, the Blessed Trinity, the Incarnation, the immortality
of the soul, and the necessity of grace. The
first two are certainly necessary for salvation, both
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fide explicitâ</span></span>
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate medii</span></span>. With regard to the other
four there is a difference of opinion among theologians.
We base our argumentation on the stricter, though not
absolutely certain view, that all six articles must be believed
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate medii</span></span>.
On this basis God's method of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
providing sufficient graces for the heathen may be explained
in one of two ways, according as a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides explicita</span></span>
is demanded from them with regard to all the above-mentioned
dogmas, or a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides implicita</span></span> is deemed
sufficient in regard to all but the first two.
By <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides explicita</span></span> we
understand the express and fully developed faith of devout Christians;
by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides implicita</span></span>, an undeveloped belief
of desire or, in other words, general readiness to believe
whatever God has revealed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The defenders of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides explicita</span></span> theory
are compelled to assume that God must somehow
reveal to each individual heathen who lives according
to the dictates of his conscience, the six
truths necessary for salvation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith cometh by
hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But how can the gentiles believe in a revelation that
has never been preached to them? Here is an undeniable
difficulty. Some theologians say: God enlightens them
interiorly about the truths necessary for salvation; or
He miraculously sends them an apostle, as He sent
St. Peter to Cornelius;<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> or He instructs them through
the agency of an angel.<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href="#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> None of these hypotheses can
be accepted as satisfactory. <span class="tei tei-q">“Interior illumination”</span> of
the kind postulated would practically amount to private
revelation. That God should grant a special private
revelation to every conscientious pagan is highly improbable.
Again, an angel can no more be the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ordinary</span></em>
means of conversion than the miraculous apparition of a
missionary. Nevertheless, these three hypotheses admirably
illustrate the firm belief of the Church in the universality
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of God's saving will, inasmuch as they express
the conviction of her theologians that He would work a
miracle rather than deny His grace to the poor benighted
heathen.<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> The difficulties to which we have adverted
constitute a strong argument in favor of another theological
theory which regards explicit belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation
merely as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas praecepti</span></span>, from
which one may be dispensed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides implicita</span></span>
theory is far more plausible, for it postulates no miracles, implicit faith
(or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides in voto</span></span>) being independent of the
external preaching of the Gospel, just as the baptism
of desire (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">baptismus in voto</span></span>) is independent of
the use of water.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cardinal Gotti regards the first-mentioned of the two
theories as safer (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tutior</span></span>),
but admits that the other is
highly probable, because it has the support of St. Thomas.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a>
However, a great difficulty remains. Though it may
suffice to hold the dogmas of the Trinity and the Incarnation,
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a fortiori</span></span> those of the immortality of the
soul and the necessity of grace, with an implicit faith, it is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the consentient teaching of Revelation, the Church, and
Catholic divines that the two principal truths of religion,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: the existence of God and retribution, must be held
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fide explicitâ</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate medii</span></span>, because a man cannot
be converted to God unless He knows Him. But
how is he to acquire a knowledge of God? Does this
not also necessitate a miracle (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the sending of an angel
or of a missionary, which we have rejected as improbable)?
There can be but one answer to this question.
Unaided reason may convince a thoughtful pagan of the
existence of God and of divine retribution, and as these
two fundamental truths have no doubt penetrated to the
farthest corners of the earth also as remnants of primitive
revelation, their promulgation may be said to be
contained in the traditional instruction which the heathen
receive from their forebears. This external factor of
Divine Revelation, assisted by interior grace, may engender
a supernatural act of faith, which implicitly includes
belief in Christ, Baptism, etc., and through which
the heathen are eventually cleansed from sin and attain to
justification.<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">What is Meant by Predestination.</span></span>—We
have shown that God antecedently wills to
save all men,<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> and that He gives to all sufficient
grace to work out their eternal salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, Sacred Scripture assures us
that some are lost through their own fault. Cfr.
Matth. XXV, 41: <span class="tei tei-q">“Depart from me, you cursed,
into everlasting fire.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It follows that God's will to save, considered
as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas consequens</span></span>,
remains ineffective with
regard to a portion of the human race, and consequently,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in this respect, is no longer universal
but particular.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Being omniscient, God has foreseen this from
all eternity and disposed His decrees accordingly.
It is in this sense that Catholic theology teaches
the existence of a twofold predestination: one to
Heaven, for those who die in the state of grace,
another to hell, for those who depart this life in
mortal sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Present-day usage reserves the term <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">predestination</span></em>
for the election of the blessed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Rightly does the Council of Trent call predestination
a <span class="tei tei-q">“hidden mystery.”</span><a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a> For in the last analysis
it rests solely with God, who are to be admitted to Heaven
and who condemned to hell. But why does God give
to some merely sufficient grace, with which they neglect
to coöperate, while on others He showers efficacious
graces that infallibly lead to eternal salvation? In this
unequal distribution of efficacious grace lies the sublime
mystery of predestination, as St. Augustine well
knew, for he says in his treatise On the Gift of Perseverance:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore, of two infants equally bound by
original sin, why the one is taken and the other left;
and of two wicked men already mature in years, why
one should be so called that he follows Him that calleth,
while the other is either not called at all, or is not called
in such a manner,—are unsearchable judgments of
God.”</span><a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) What is meant by <span class="tei tei-q">“predestination of the elect”</span>?
In view of the many errors that have arisen with regard
to this important dogma, it is necessary to start with
clearly defined terms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Predestination may mean one of three different things.
A man may be simply predestined to receive certain graces
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinatio ad gratiam
tantum</span></span>); or he may be predestined
to enjoy eternal happiness without regard to
any merits of his own (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinatio
ad gloriam tantum</span></span>);
or, again, he may be predestined to both grace and
glory, glory as the end, grace as a means to that end—vocation,
justification, and final perseverance. When the
concepts of grace and glory are considered separately, and
each is made the object of a special predestination, we
have what is called incomplete or inadequate predestination
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinatio
incompleta sive inadaequata</span></span>). It
is this incomplete predestination that St. Paul<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a> and St.
Augustine<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href="#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a> have in mind when they apply the term
to the vocation of men to grace, faith, and justification. Theologians
speak of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinatio ad gloriam tantum</span></span>, that
is, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ante praevisa merita</span></span>,
as a true predestination, but disagree
as to its existence.<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dogma of predestination, which mainly concerns
us here, has for its sole object predestination in the complete
or adequate sense of the term, which is explained
by St. Augustine as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Predestination is nothing
else than the foreknowledge and the preparation of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those gifts of God whereby they who are delivered are most certainly delivered
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> saved].”</span><a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a> St. Thomas expresses
himself more succinctly: <span class="tei tei-q">“Predestination is
the preparation of grace in the present, and of glory in
the future.”</span><a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Dogma.</span></span>—Complete predestination involves:
(a) the first grace of vocation (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
prima praeveniens</span></span>), especially faith as the beginning,
foundation, and root of justification;
(b) a number of additional actual graces for the
successful accomplishment of the process; (c)
justification itself as the beginning of the state of
grace; (d) the grace of final perseverance; (e)
eternal happiness in Heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question arises; Do men really seek and
find their eternal salvation with infallible certainty
by passing through these successive stages—not
merely in the foreknowledge of God
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praescientia futurorum</span></span>), but by virtue of an
eternal decree (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">decretum praedestinationis</span></span>)?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pelagians asserted that man works out his eternal
salvation of his own free will, and that consequently
God merely foreknows but does not fore-ordain who shall
be saved. The Semipelagians held that the beginning of
faith (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">initium fidei</span></span>)
and final perseverance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">donum perseverantiae</span></span>)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are not pure graces but may be obtained by
natural means, without special aid from above. Against
these heretics the Catholic Church has always taught the
eternal predestination of the elect as an article of faith.<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) St. Paul says explicitly: <span class="tei tei-q">“We know that to
them that love God, all things work together unto
good, to such as, according to his purpose, are
called to be saints. For whom he foreknew, he
also predestinated to be made conformable to the
image of his Son; that he might be the firstborn
amongst many brethren. And whom he predestinated,
them he also called. And whom he
called, them he also justified. And whom he justified,
them he also glorified.”</span><a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> Here we have
all the elements of complete predestination: God's
eternal foreknowledge (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praescivit</span></span>,
προέγνω), an eternal decree of the divine will
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinavit</span></span>,
προώρισε), and the various stages of justification,
beginning with vocation (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vocavit</span></span>,
ἐκάλησε) up to justification proper
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">iustificavit</span></span>,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The Fathers of the fifth century undoubtedly
taught the predestination of the elect as an
article of faith. Thus St. Augustine says:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“There never was a time when the Church of
Christ did not hold this faith in predestination,
which is now defended with fresh solicitude
against the new heretics.”</span><a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> His faithful disciple
St. Prosper writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“No Catholic denies
predestination by God.”</span><a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“It
would be as impious to deny predestination as to
oppose grace itself.”</span><a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Several important theological corollaries
follow from the dogma of predestination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The first is the immutability of the divine
decree of predestination. This immutability is
based on God's infallible foreknowledge that certain
individuals will die in the state of grace, and
on His unchangeable will to reward them with
eternal happiness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Augustine says: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one of these [the predestined]
perishes, God is mistaken; but none of them
perish because God is not mistaken.”</span><a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God's unerring foreknowledge is symbolized by the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Book of Life.”</span><a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> Christ Himself said to His Apostles:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Rejoice in this, that your names are written in
heaven.”</span><a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a>
The <span class="tei tei-q">“Book of Life”</span> admits neither addition
nor erasure. This does not, however, mean that
a man is unable to change God's hypothetical decree
of predestination with regard to himself into an
absolute one. He can do this by prayer, good works,
and faithful co-operation with grace.<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> Whatever promotes
our salvation is included in the infallible foreknowledge
of God, and consequently also in the scope of predestination.
In this sense, but in no other, can we accept
the somewhat paradoxical maxim: <span class="tei tei-q">“If you are not predestined,
conduct yourself so that you may be predestined.”</span>
Sacred Scripture occasionally refers to another
<span class="tei tei-q">“Book of Life,”</span> which contains the names of all
the faithful, irrespective of their predestination. This
<span class="tei tei-q">“book,”</span> of course, is capable of alterations. Cfr. Apoc.
III, 5: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will not blot out his name out of the book
of life.”</span><a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> Finally, there is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Book of Reprobation,”</span>
which records the wicked deeds of men and by which the
unrepentant sinners will be judged. This is the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">liber
scriptus</span></span>”</span> of the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Dies Irae</span></span>”</span>:

</div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) If the divine decree of predestination is immutable,
the number of the elect must be definitively
fixed. <span class="tei tei-q">“The number [of those who are
predestined to the kingdom of God] is so certain,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
says St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“that no one can either be
added to or taken from them.”</span><a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a> We must distinguish
between the absolute and the relative
number of the predestined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God, being omniscient, knows not only the abstract
number of the elect, but every individual predestined to
Heaven. To us the number of the elect is wrapped in
impenetrable mystery. St. Thomas justly observes:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Some say that as many men will be saved as angels
fell; some, so many as there were angels left; others,
in fine, so many as the number of angels who fell, added
to that of all the angels created by God. It is, however,
better to say that <span class="tei tei-q">‘God alone knows the number
for whom is reserved eternal happiness,’</span> as the prayer
for the living and the dead expresses it.”</span><a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a> Whether
God will round out the number of the elect by suddenly
precipitating the end of the world or by a sort of <span class="tei tei-q">“natural
selection,”</span> is an open question. To assume the latter
could hardly be reconciled with the dogma of the
universality of His saving will. St. Augustine seems to
favor the former.<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As regards the relative number of the elect, some
writers (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> Massillon) represent it as so infinitesimally
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
small that it would almost drive a saint to despair,—<span class="tei tei-q">“as
if the Church had been established for the express purpose
of populating hell.”</span><a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a> Even St. Thomas held that
relatively few are saved.<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> But the arguments adduced
in support of this contention are by no means convincing.<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href="#note_596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a>
Recently, the Jesuit Father Castelein<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href="#note_597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a> impugned
the rigorist theory with weighty arguments. He
was sharply attacked by the Redemptorist Godts,<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href="#note_598"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a> who
marshalled a great number of authorities in favor of
the sterner view. The controversy cannot be decided
either on Scriptural or traditional grounds. In our
pessimistic age it is more grateful and consoling to
assume that the majority of Christians, especially
Catholics, will be saved.<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a> If we add to this number not
a few Jews, Mohammedans, and heathens, it is probably
safe to estimate the number of the elect as at least equal
to that of the reprobates. Were it smaller, <span class="tei tei-q">“it could

cause, grace; its final cause, the divine
glory; its primary meritorious cause, the merits
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. On these
points all theologians are agreed. Not so as to
the motive that induced God to predestine certain
individuals to the exclusion of others. The question
narrows itself down to this: What influence,
if any, do the merits of a man exert on the
eternal decree of predestination?—and may be
formulated in three different ways.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) What influence do the merits of a man exert
on his predestination to the initial grace of
vocation? Recalling the dogma of the absolute
gratuity of grace, our answer must be: None.
For whatever merits one may have acquired
before he receives the initial grace of vocation,
must be purely natural, and consequently
worthless in the eyes of God for supernatural
predestination. <span class="tei tei-q">“To assume,”</span> says St. Thomas,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that there is on our part some merit, the foreknowledge
of which [on the part of God] would
be the cause [motive] of our predestination,
would be to assume that grace is given to us [as
a reward] of our [natural] merits.”</span><a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a>

b) What influence do the merits of a man
exert on his predestination to grace and glory?
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Catholic theologians are unanimous in holding
that, since grace is absolutely gratuitous and
inseparably connected with glory as its effect, the
union of both can no more be based upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span></em>
merit than the initial grace of vocation itself,
which transmits the quality of gratuitousness to
each and every one of the graces that follow in
its wake, up to and including justification and
eternal beatitude. Those among the Fathers who
defended the gratuity of predestination against
the Pelagians and Semipelagians, really aimed at
safeguarding the gratuity of initial grace, in order
not to be constrained to say with Pelagius
that <span class="tei tei-q">“the grace of God is given as a reward of
merit.”</span><a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“What compelled me in this work of
mine [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Dono Perseverantiae</span></span>] to defend more
abundantly and clearly those passages of Scripture
in which predestination is commended,”</span> says
St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“if not the Pelagian assertion that
God's grace is given according to our [natural]
merits?”</span><a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> Obviously these Fathers did not
have in view the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinatio ad gloriam

they meant was that complete predestination
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which comprises grace and glory as one whole.
Similarly, the early Schoolmen, when they speak
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“gratuity of predestination,”</span> usually mean
complete predestination.<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> D'Argentré's researches
show how necessary it is to draw sharp
distinctions and carefully to establish the real
state of the question before claiming the common
teaching of the Scholastics in favor of any particular
theory of predestination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) What influence do the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supernatural</span></em> merits
of a man exert on his predestination to glory as
such? Here the controversy begins. Predestination
may be considered either as the cause of
supernatural merit or as its effect. If it is considered
as the cause, the problem takes this shape:
Did God, by an absolute decree, and without any
regard to their future supernatural merits, eternally
predestine certain men to the glory of heaven,
and only subsequently decide to give them the
efficacious graces necessary to reach that end, particularly
final perseverance? If, on the other
hand, predestination be considered as an effect of
supernatural merit, the question will be: Did
God predestine certain men to the glory of Heaven
by a merely hypothetical decree, making His will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to save them dependent on His infallible foreknowledge
of their supernatural merits? The
lack of decisive Scriptural and Patristic texts on
this subject has led to a division of Catholic opinion,
some theologians favoring absolute predestination
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ante praevisa merita</span></span>, others hypothetical
predestination <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">post praevisa merita</span></span>. Without
concealing our conviction that absolute predestination
is untenable, we shall set forth both
theories impartially and examine the arguments
on which they rely.

4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Orthodox Predestinationism, or the
Theory of Predestination ante Praevisa
Merita.</span></span>—Some theologians conceive the divine
scheme of salvation in this wise: (a) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">In ordine
intentionis</span></span>, God, by an absolute decree, first predestines
certain men to eternal salvation, and
then, in consequence of this decree, decides to give
them all the graces necessary to be saved; (b)
in time, however, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in ordine executionis</span></span>,
He observes the reverse order, that is to say, He
first bestows the pre-appointed graces and subsequently
the glory of heaven as a reward of supernatural
merit acquired by the aid of those graces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This theory reverses the relation of grace and
glory. While it correctly<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a>
represents glory as the fruit
and reward of supernatural merit in the order of execution,
it wrongly represents it in the order of intention as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the cause of supernatural merit, whereas it is merely an effect. This
opinion is championed by most Thomists,<a id="noteref_606" name="noteref_606" href="#note_606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a>
some Augustinians,<a id="noteref_607" name="noteref_607" href="#note_607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">607</span></span></a> and a few Molinists.<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a> Their arguments
may be sketched as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) In innumerable passages of Sacred Scripture
predestination to eternal happiness is represented
as a work of pure mercy, nay, even as an
arbitrary act of God. Take, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, Matth. XXIV,
22 sqq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“And unless those days had been shortened,
no flesh should be saved: but for the sake of
the elect those days shall be shortened.... For
there shall arise false Christs and false prophets,
and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible)
even the elect.”</span><a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609" href="#note_609"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a>
Here, it is claimed, the elect are represented as so
thoroughly confirmed in faith and in good works
as to be proof against error.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This conclusion is unwarranted. The phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“those
days”</span> manifestly refers either to the destruction of Jerusalem
or to the end of the world. If it refers to the destruction
of Jerusalem, the <span class="tei tei-q">“elect,”</span> according to Biblical
usage,<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href="#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a>
are the faithful Christian inhabitants of the Holy
City, for whose sake God promises to shorten the terrible
siege. If it referred to the end of the world,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">electi</span></span> would
indeed stand for <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinati</span></span>,
but the context would not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
forbid us to interpret their predestination hypothetically,
as merely indicating the immutability of the divine decree,
which is not denied by the opponents of the theory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another text quoted in favor of absolute predestination
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ante praevisa merita</span></span>,
is Acts XIII, 48: <span class="tei tei-q">“As many
as were ordained (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praeordinati</span></span>,
τεταγμένοι) to life everlasting,
believed.”</span> Here, we are told, predestination to
eternal life is given as the motive why many believed.
But the text really says nothing at all about predestination.
Τεταγμένοι is not synonymous with προτεταγμένοι or
προωρισμένοι. The more probable explanation is the following:
As many believed as were disposed to receive
the faith. It is wellnigh impossible to assume that all
who received the faith at that time were predestined,
while those that refused to be converted were without
exception reprobates. But even if
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praeordinati</span></span> were
synonymous with <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinati</span></span>,
the text would merely
say that certain predestined souls embraced the faith,
without affording any clue as to the relation between
conversion and predestination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ninth chapter of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans
is the main reliance of the advocates of absolute predestinationism,
though the passage is unfit to serve as a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus classicus</span></span>
because of its obscurity. Let us examine
a few of the verses most frequently quoted. Rom.
IX, 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated,”</span>
is alleged to prove the absolute predestination of Jacob
and the negative reprobation of Esau. But many theologians
hold that Esau was saved, and, besides, the
Apostle is not dealing with predestination to glory, but
with Jacob's vocation to be the progenitor of the Messias.
Esau, who was not an Israelite but an Idumaean,
was simply passed over in this choice
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">odio habere
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
minus diligere</span></span>; cfr. Matth. X, 37). If the passage is
interpreted typically, it should be done in harmony
with the context, that is to say, as referring to the gratuity
of grace, not to predestination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same may be said of Rom. IX, 16 and 18: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
God that showeth mercy.... He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom
he will he hardeneth.”</span><a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href="#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The strongest text alleged by the advocates of absolute
predestination is Rom. IX, 20 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“O man, who art
thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed
say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me
thus? Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of
the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another
unto dishonor?”</span> Here the Apostle really seems
to have thought of predestination. But the simile must
not be pressed, lest we arrive at the Calvinistic blasphemy
that God positively predestined some men to heaven and
others to hell. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">tertium
comparationis</span></span> is not the act
of the Divine Artificer, but the willingness of man to
yield his will to God like clay in the hands of a potter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor is it admissible to read into the Apostle's thought
even a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">negative</span></em> reprobation of certain men. For the
primary intention of the Epistle to the Romans is to
insist on the gratuity of man's vocation to Christianity
and to reject the presumption that the Mosaic law and
their bodily descent from Abraham gave the Jews preference
over the heathens. The Epistle to the Romans has
no bearing whatever on the speculative question whether
or not the free vocation of grace is a necessary result of
eternal predestination to glory.<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a>

b) Among the Fathers the only one to whom
the advocates of absolute predestinationism can
appeal with some show of justice is St. Augustine,
who, with the possible exception of Prosper
and Fulgentius, was the most rigorous among
early ecclesiastical writers,—so rigorous, in fact,
that Oswald does not hesitate to call him <span class="tei tei-q">“the head and
front of all rigorists in the Church.”</span><a id="noteref_613" name="noteref_613" href="#note_613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">613</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However, this is saying too much. Augustine's genuine
teaching is still in dispute among our ablest theologians.
Some<a id="noteref_614" name="noteref_614" href="#note_614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">614</span></span></a> deny that he broke with the almost
unanimous teaching of his predecessors, while others
think that in the treatises <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Dono
Perseverantiae</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
Praedestinatione Sanctorum</span></span>, and in several of his letters,
the Saint frankly taught absolute predestinationism. The
latter group of writers is split into two classes. A number
of Thomists and Cardinal Bellarmine not only assert
that Augustine taught absolute predestination, but boldly
adopt his supposed teaching. Petavius, Maldonatus, Cercià, Oswald,
and others censure this view. Franzelin<a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href="#note_615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a>
undoubtedly strikes the right note when he says:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If there were a manifest discrepancy between Augustine's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
teaching and that of the other Fathers, I should not
hesitate to follow Pighius, Catharinus, Osorius, Camerarius,
Maldonatus,<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href="#note_616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a> Toletus,<a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href="#note_617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a> and Petavius<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href="#note_618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a> in reverently

Under these circumstances the Patristic argument for the
theory of absolute predestination evidently lacks convincingness.<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href="#note_620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) It was probably because they felt its weakness
that some of the later champions of the
theory attempted to prove absolute predestination
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ante praevisa merita</span></span> by philosophical
arguments. Gonet reasons as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“He who proceeds in
an orderly way, wills the end before he wills the
means necessary to attain it. But God proceeds
in an orderly way. Therefore he wills the end
before the means. Now, glory is an end, and
merits are means to attain that end. Consequently,
God wills glory before He wills merits,
and a man's preëlection to glory cannot be based
on foreknowledge of his merits.”</span><a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href="#note_621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> This argument,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
if it proved anything, would prove the
logical impossibility of conditional predestination.
But it overshoots the mark and consequently
proves nothing at all. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Qui nimium probat, nihil
probat.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Gonet moreover assumes what he sets out to prove,
namely, that God <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntate antecedente</span></span>
decreed the glory of certain men to the exclusion of others. This
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">petitio principii</span></span> vitiates the entire
polysyllogism. God's will to save is universal. He wills the eternal happiness
of all men <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">antecedenter</span></span>, and the reprobation of
some only <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consequenter</span></span>; hence eternal
predestination is not absolute, but hypothetical, that is, it depends on merit.
That the divine scheme of grace can take a different
course <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in ordine intentionis</span></span>
from that <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in ordine executionis</span></span>
is a mere fiction. If eternal salvation in the order of
temporal execution is given only as a reward of merit,
it must be a reward of merit also in the order of intention.
In both cases predestination depends upon a future
condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the worst feature of the theory of absolute predestination
is the fact that it involves the absolute reprobation
of those not predestined to glory. <span class="tei tei-q">“If it could
be validly argued,”</span> says Gutberlet, <span class="tei tei-q">“that, since the end
must be willed before the means, salvation must be
decreed before the means to its attainment (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> merits),
the argument would be applicable also to the damned.
If God <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntate antecedente</span></span> wills to lead
only a few to salvation, and if this intention must precede every other,
then He must likewise <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntate antecedente</span></span>
have in view the end of the reprobates, which is His own glorification
through the manifestation of His justice and mercy.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hence He must also decree the means necessary to obtain
this end, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> He must cause these unfortunate creatures to
sin, in order that they may reach the end for which He
has predestined them; in other words, He must pre-ordain
them to sin and eternal damnation,”</span><a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href="#note_622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a> which is what Calvin
teaches. The advocates of the theory naturally shrink
from adopting such a blasphemous conclusion, and fall
back upon the theory of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">negative</span></em> reprobation, which, however,
amounts practically to the same thing.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href="#note_623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a>

5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Theory of Hypothetical Predestination

like God's will to save all men, is based
on a hypothetical decree. Those only are predestined
to eternal happiness who shall merit it
as a reward. It is solely by reason of His infallible
foreknowledge of these merits that God's hypothetical
decree of predestination becomes absolute.
Or, as Becanus puts it, <span class="tei tei-q">“God first prepared

merita</span></span> as <span class="tei tei-q">“more in harmony with the mercy and grace of God, truer and

has a solid basis both in Scripture and Tradition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Holy Scripture clearly teaches the universality
of God's saving will. Now if God <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntate

men without exception,<a id="noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> He cannot possibly intend
that only some shall be saved.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is further to be noted that the Bible makes not only
the temporal realization but likewise the eternal promise
of glory dependent on the performance of good works. St. Paul, whose Epistle to
the Romans is cited as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">locus classicus</span></span>
by the advocates of the theory,<a id="noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a> wrote towards
the end of his life to Timothy: <span class="tei tei-q">“I have fought a
good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
faith. As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown
of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to
me in that day.”</span><a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href="#note_628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">628</span></span></a> In writing these lines the Apostle
no doubt had in mind the sentence of the Universal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Judge: <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world,”</span><a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href="#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a>—which may with far greater reason be termed
a <span class="tei tei-q">“classical”</span> text than the obscure ninth chapter of the
Epistle to the Romans. To prepare for men the kingdom
of heaven from the foundation (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> beginning) of the
world, is to predestine them to eternal happiness. Now,
God has <span class="tei tei-q">“prepared”</span> the kingdom of heaven for men in
view of their foreseen merits, that is to say, conditionally. The causal
conjunction <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">enim</span></span> in the sentence following the
one just quoted (Matth. XXVI, 25): <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Esurivi enim et
dedistis mihi manducare</span></span>, etc.,”</span> refers to the entire preceding
sentence, not only to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">possidete</span></span> in time,
but also to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">paratum</span></span> in eternity.
Consequently, the eternal decree of predestination itself, like its temporal
execution, depends on good works or merit. This interpretation
of Matth. XXV, 34-36 is confirmed by the
sentence pronounced upon the reprobates, Matth. XXV,
41 sqq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting
fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels.
For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat,
etc.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-q">“everlasting fire”</span> is manifestly decreed
from all eternity in the same sense in which it is inflicted in
time, namely, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">propter et post praevisa merita</span></span>.

for <span class="tei tei-q">“the devil and his angels”</span> is untenable, because in

expressly classed among the followers of Satan. If we
add to this that our Divine Lord, in foretelling the last

not only to show its absolute justice but likewise to intimate
that, had they so willed, the damned might have had
their place on the right hand of the Great Judge, we
must admit that the theory of predestination
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">post praevisa

writers as absolutely predestined to eternal glory are: the
Blessed Virgin Mary, the prophets and Apostles, St. Joseph,
St. Aloysius, and a few others, as well as all infants
dying in the grace of Baptism. Billuart,<a id="noteref_648" name="noteref_648" href="#note_648"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">648</span></span></a> Dominicus
Soto, and certain other divines attack this theory on the
ground that it makes the salvation of the great majority
of the elect a matter of chance and thereby imperils the
dogmatic teaching of the Church. This objection is unfounded.
For though the <span class="tei tei-q">“eclectic”</span> theory has little or
no support either in Revelation or in reason, it sufficiently
safeguards the dogma of predestination by admitting that

none but the predestined can attain
to eternal beatitude.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reprobation of the damned is sometimes called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedestinatio ad

There can be no absolute and positive predestination
to eternal punishment, and the pains of hell can
be threatened only in view of mortal sin. Hence reprobation
may be defined, in the words of Peter Lombard, as

the preparation of their damnation.”</span><a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href="#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a>

According to this abominable heresy, the sin of Adam
and the spiritual ruin which it entailed upon his descendants
are attributable solely to the will of God. God produces
in the reprobate a <span class="tei tei-q">“semblance of faith,”</span> only to
make them all the more deserving of damnation. In the
beginning of the seventeenth century Arminius and a few
other theologians of the Dutch Reformed Church, repelled
by Calvin's <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">decretum
horribile</span></span>, ascribed the positive reprobation
of the damned to original sin
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lapsus</span></span>). These
writers, called Infralapsarians or Postlapsarians, were
opposed by the strict school of Calvinist divines under
the leadership of Gomarus. The great Calvinist Synod of
Dordrecht (1618-1619) condemned the principles of Arminius,
and subsequently his adherents were driven from
Holland.

The general principle laid down in this quotation is
variously developed by Thomist theologians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rigorists (Alvarez, John a S. Thoma, Estius, Sylvius)
assign as the motive of reprobation the sovereign
will of God. God, they say, without taking into account possible sins
and demerits, determined <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> to exclude
from Heaven those who are not predestined. De Lemos,
Gotti, Gonet, Gazzaniga, and others condemn this view as
incompatible with the teaching of St. Thomas, and, appealing to
St. Augustine's doctrine of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">massa damnata</span></span>,
find the ultimate reason for the exclusion of the
reprobates from heaven in original sin, in which God,
without being unjust, could leave as many as He saw
fit. Goudin, Graveson, Billuart, and others assume that
the reprobates are not directly excluded from eternal glory
but merely from <span class="tei tei-q">“effective election”</span> thereunto, God simply having decreed
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ante praevisa merita</span></span> to leave them to
their weakness.<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href="#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the Thomists found no difficulty in harmonizing
this view with their theory of physical premotion,
the few Molinists who espoused it were hard put
in trying to square it with the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia
media</span></span>.<a id="noteref_669" name="noteref_669" href="#note_669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a> On the
whole these Molinists endorse the third and mildest
of the above-quoted opinions, which differs only
theoretically from the rigoristic view described in the first
place. Practically it makes no difference whether God
directly excludes a man from heaven or refuses to give
him the graces necessary to attain it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Surveying all three of the theories under consideration
we cannot but regard the first and third as heartless
and cruel, because they attribute eternal reprobation
to a positive decree that takes effect independently of
sin; the second, (which ascribes reprobation to original
sin), is open to the serious dogmatic objection that it contradicts
the teaching of St. Paul and the Tridentine declaration
that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is no condemnation
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">nihil damnationis</span></span>)
in those who are truly buried together with Christ
by baptism into death.”</span><a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href="#note_670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Negative reprobation is rightly regarded as
the logical counterpart of absolute predestination.<a id="noteref_671" name="noteref_671" href="#note_671"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a>
If Almighty God, by an absolute decree,
without regard to any possible merits, merely to
reveal His divine attributes and to <span class="tei tei-q">“embellish the
universe,”</span> had determined that only those could
enter the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Jerusalem”</span> who were antecedently
predestined thereto, it would inevitably
follow that the unfortunate remainder of humanity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the very same decree were <span class="tei tei-q">“passed over,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“omitted,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“overlooked,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“not elected,”</span> or, as
Gonet honestly admits, <span class="tei tei-q">“excluded from Heaven,”</span>
which is the same thing as being negatively condemned
to hell.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The logical distinction between positive and negative
reprobation, therefore, consists mainly in this, that the
former signifies absolute damnation to hell, the latter
(equally absolute) non-election to Heaven. To protect
the Catholic champions of negative reprobation against
unjust aspersions, however, it is necessary to point out
certain fundamental differences between their theory and
the heresy of Calvin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Calvin and the Jansenists openly deny the universality
both of God's saving will and of the atonement; they refuse
to admit the actual bestowal of sufficient grace upon
those fore-ordained to eternal damnation; and claim
that the human will loses its freedom under the predominance
of efficacious grace or concupiscence. The Catholic
defenders of negative reprobation indignantly reject
the charge that their position logically leads to any such
heretical implications.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The theory of negative reprobation can be
sufficiently refuted by showing that it is incompatible
with the universality of God's will to save
all men. For if God willed absolutely and antecedently
to <span class="tei tei-q">“exclude some men from Heaven,”</span>
as Gonet asserts, or <span class="tei tei-q">“not to elect them to eternal
glory,”</span> as Suarez contends, then it would be His
absolute will that they perish.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) For one thus negatively reprobated it is metaphysically
impossible to attain eternal salvation. To hold
otherwise would be tantamount to assuming that an
essentially absolute decree of God can be frustrated.
This consideration led certain Thomists<a id="noteref_672" name="noteref_672" href="#note_672"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a> to describe the
divine <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntas salvifica</span></span>
as rather an ineffectual
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">velleitas</span></span>.<a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673" href="#note_673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a>
But this conflicts with the obvious teaching of
Revelation.<a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674" href="#note_674"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">674</span></span></a>
Suarez labors in vain to reconcile the sincerity of
God's salvific will with the theory of negative reprobation.
The two are absolutely irreconcilable. How could God
sincerely will the salvation of all men if it were true, as
Suarez says, that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not in man's power to work out
his eternal salvation in case he falls under non-election,
non-predestination, or, which amounts to the same thing,
negative reprobation”</span>?<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675" href="#note_675"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">675</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) The cruel absurdity of the theory of negative
reprobation becomes fully apparent when we consider
the attitude it ascribes to God. Gonet writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“Foreseeing
that the whole human race would be depraved by
original sin, God, in view of the merits of Christ who
was to come, elected some men to glory and, in punishment
of original sin and to show His justice towards
them and His greater mercy towards the elect, permitted
others to miss the attainment of beatitude, in other words,
He positively willed that they should not attain it....
In virtue of this efficacious intention He devised appropriate
means for the attainment of His purpose, and seeing
that some would miss beatitude by simply being left
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the state of original sin, and others by being permitted
to fall into actual sins and to persevere therein, He
formally decreed this permission, and finally ... by a
command of His intellect ordained these means towards
the attainment of the aforesaid end.”</span><a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676" href="#note_676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a> Translated into
plain every-day language this can only mean that God tries
with all His might to prevent the reprobate from attaining
eternal salvation and sees to it that they die in the
state of sin. Suarez is perfectly right in characterizing Gonet's teaching as
<span class="tei tei-q">“incompatible with sound doctrine.”</span><a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677" href="#note_677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">677</span></span></a>
But his own teaching is equally unsound and
cruel. For he, too, is compelled to assert: <span class="tei tei-q">“Predestination
to glory is the motive for which efficacious or infallible
means towards attaining that end are bestowed.
Hence to refuse to predestine a man for glory is to deny
him the means which are recognized as fit and certain to
attain that end.”</span><a id="noteref_678" name="noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Holy Scripture fortunately speaks a different language.
It describes God as a loving Father, who <span class="tei tei-q">“wills not
that any should perish, but that all should return to
penance.”</span><a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href="#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a>

γ) Practically it makes no difference whether a man is
positively condemned to eternal damnation, as Calvin
and the Jansenists assert, or negatively excluded from
Heaven, as held by the orthodox theologians whom we
have just quoted. The alleged distinction between positive
and negative reprobation is <span class="tei tei-q">“a distinction without a difference.”</span>
For an adult to be excluded from Heaven simply
means that he is damned. There is no such thing as a
middle state or a purely natural beatitude. Lessius justly
says that to one reprobated by God it would be all the
same whether his reprobation was positive or negative,
because in either case he would be inevitably
lost.<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href="#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a>

free in Paradise, but lost its freedom by original sin; (2)
that we cannot be delivered from the slavery of Satan
except by the grace of Christ, which does not, however,

(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">libertas a necessitate</span></span>), and maintaining

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Jansenist teaching on the subject of grace may
be outlined as follows: (1) By original sin man lost
the moral liberty which he had enjoyed in Paradise
and became subject to a twofold delectation—<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis victrix</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio terrena sive carnalis
victrix</span></span>. (2) These two delectations are continually
contending for the mastery; the stronger always defeats
the weaker, (3) and the will, unable to offer
resistance, is alternately overpowered now by the one
and then by the other.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href="#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a> (4) In each case the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis</span></span> is either stronger than
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio terrena</span></span>,
or it is weaker, or it is of equal strength. When it is
stronger, the will is overcome by grace, which in that
case becomes <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficax</span></span> or
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">irresistibilis</span></span>. When it is weaker,
the will simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em> sin, because the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis</span></span>
is too weak to overcome the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio
terrena</span></span>. The grace given to a man under such conditions is called by the
Jansenists <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia parva sive sufficiens</span></span>.
When the two delectations are equally strong, the will finds itself unable
to come to a definite decision.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This false teaching inspired the famous <span class="tei tei-q">“five propositions”</span>
of Jansenius, to-wit: (1) Man is unable to keep
some of God's commandments for want of grace;
(2) In the state of fallen nature no one ever resists
interior grace; (3) To merit or demerit in the state of
fallen nature it is sufficient to be free from external
constraint; (4) The Semipelagian heresy consisted in assuming
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the existence of a grace which man may either
obey or resist; and (5) Christ did not die for all men,
but solely for the predestined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These propositions were condemned as heretical
by Pope Innocent X in his dogmatic Bull
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cum occasione</span></span>,”</span> of May 31, 1653. All five are
implicitly contained in the second, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: In the
state of fallen nature no one ever resists interior
grace. <span class="tei tei-q">“If it is true that fallen man never resists
interior grace (second proposition), it follows
that a just man who violates a commandment of
God has not had the grace to observe it, that he
therefore transgressed it through inability to fulfil
it (first proposition). If, however, he has
sinned and thus incurred demerit, it is clear that
the liberty of indifference is not a requisite condition
of demerit, and what is said of demerit is
likewise true of its correlative, merit (third
proposition). On the other hand, if grace is
wanting to the just whenever they fall, it is wanting
still more to sinners; it is therefore impossible
to maintain that the death of Jesus Christ assured
to every man the graces necessary for salvation
(fifth proposition). As a further consequence,
the Semipelagians were in error in admitting the
universal distribution of a grace which may be
resisted (fourth proposition).”</span><a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href="#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a>

b) As regards Tradition, the Greek Fathers
who wrote before St. Augustine defended the
freedom of the will so energetically that they
were subsequently accused of harboring Pelagian
and Semipelagian errors.<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href="#note_698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The one exception noted is St. Augustine, to whom both
Calvin and Jansenius appeal with great confidence. It
should be noted, however, that the point which chiefly
concerned St. Augustine in his controversies with the
Pelagians and Semipelagians, was the necessity and
gratuity of grace, not its relation to free-will. Where he
incidentally touches upon the latter, he shows by the manner
in which he formulates his sentences that he regards
the relation of grace to free-will as a great mystery. But
he does not try to solve this mystery in the manner in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot. He
does not declare: Grace is everything, free-will is nothing.
If the power of grace destroyed the freedom of the
human will, their mutual relation would be no problem.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href="#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>
Possibly St. Augustine in the heat of controversy
now and then expressed himself in language open to
misinterpretation, as when he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore aid was
brought to the infirmity of the human will, so that it
might be unchangeably and invincibly influenced by divine
grace.”</span><a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href="#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a>
But this and similar phrases admit of a
perfectly orthodox interpretation. As the context shows,
Augustine merely wished to assert the hegemony of
grace in all things pertaining to salvation, and to emphasize
the fact that free-will, strengthened by grace, is
able to resist even the most grievous temptations.<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href="#note_702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a> At
no period of his life did the Saint deny the freedom
of the will under the influence of grace. We will quote
but two out of many available passages in proof of this
statement. <span class="tei tei-q">“To yield consent or to withhold it, whenever God calls, is
the function of one's own will.”</span><a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href="#note_703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">703</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“For the freedom of the will is not destroyed because
the will is aided; but it is aided precisely for the reason
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that it remains free.”</span><a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> St. Bernard of Clairvaux
echoes this teaching when, in his own ingenious way, he
summarizes the Catholic dogma as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Take
away free will and there will be nothing left to save; take away grace and there
will be no means left of salvation.”</span><a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href="#note_705"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">705</span></span></a>

Of Grace And Free-Will</span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relation of grace to free-will may be regarded
from a twofold point of view. We may
take grace as the primary factor and trace it in
its action on the human will; or, starting from
the latter, we may endeavor to ascertain how free-will
is affected by grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first-mentioned method has given birth to two
closely related theological systems, Thomism and Augustinianism;
the latter to Molinism and Congruism, which
are almost identical in substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides these there is a fifth theory, which tries
to reconcile the two extremes and may therefore be called
eclectic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the human will is free, yet subject to the influence
of grace, is an article of faith unhesitatingly accepted
by all Catholic theologians. It is in trying to explain how
grace and free-will coöperate, that the above-mentioned
schools differ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In approaching this extremely difficult and obscure
problem we consider it our duty to warn the student
against preconceived opinions and to remind him that the
different systems which we are about to examine are all
tolerated by the Church. To-day, when so many more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
important things are at stake and the faith is viciously
assailed from without, the ancient controversy between
Thomism and Molinism had better be left in abeyance.

Thomism and Augustinianism both hinge on
the concept of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax ab intrinseco s. per

1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Thomistic Theory of Grace.</span></span>—The
true founder of the Thomistic system is not St.
Thomas Aquinas, who is also claimed by the
Molinists, but the learned Dominican theologian
Bañez (1528-1604). His teaching may be
summarized as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) God is the First Cause (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa prima</span></span>)
and Prime Mover (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motor primus</span></span>) of all things,
and all created or secondary causes (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causae
secundae</span></span>) derive their being and faculties, nay, their very acts from Him. If
any creature could act independently of God, God would
cease to be <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa prima</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motor primus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The influence of the First Cause is universal, that
is to say, it produces all creatural acts without exception,—necessary
and free, good and bad,—because no secondary
cause has power to act unless it is set in motion
by the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motor primus</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In influencing His creatures, however, God adapts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
himself to the peculiar nature of each. The necessary
causes He determines to act necessarily, the free causes,
freely. All receive from Him their substance and their
mode of action.<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href="#note_707"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">707</span></span></a> The rational creature,
therefore, though subject to His determining influence, acts with perfect
freedom, just as if it were not moved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) In spite of free-will, however, the influence which
God exerts on His rational creatures is irresistible because
it proceeds from an absolute and omnipotent Being
whose decrees brook no opposition. What God wills
infallibly happens.<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevertheless, God is not the author of sin. He moves
the sinner to perform an act; but He does not move
Him to perform a sinful act. The malice of sin derives
solely from the free will of man.<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Since the divine influence causally precedes all
creatural acts, God's concurrence with creatural causes
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus generalis</span></span>) must be conceived as
prevenient, not simultaneous. The Divine Omnipotence not only
makes the action possible, but likewise effects it by moving
the will from potentiality to actuality.<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href="#note_710"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">710</span></span></a> Consequently,
the causal influence which the Creator exerts upon His
creatures is not a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motio</span></span>, but a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio</span></span>,—and not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
merely moral, but physical (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio

by physical premotion that God's prevenient influence
effects the free actions of His creatures, without regard
to their assent.<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href="#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a>

it determines itself.<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
d) If we analyse God's physical predeterminations in
so far as they are created entities, we find that they are
nothing else than the effect and execution of His eternal
decrees, embodied in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedeterminatio
physica</span></span>. It is the temporal execution of the latter that is called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio physica</span></span>. Hence we are
justified in speaking, not only of a temporal
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio</span></span>, but of an eternal
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedeterminatio</span></span>,
in fact the terms are often used synonymously.<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Viewed in its relation to rational creatures, this eternal
predetermination is nothing but a temporal premotion
of the free will to determine itself. Since God has
from all eternity made absolute and conditional decrees,
which possess the power of physical predetermination
without regard to the free consent of His creatures, physical
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
predetermination constitutes an infallible medium
by which He can foreknow their future free actions,
and hence there is no need of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia
media</span></span>. If God
knows His own will, He must also know the free determinations
included therein. To deny this would be
to destroy the very foundation of His foreknowledge.<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is merely the philosophical basis of the Thomistic
system. Its champions carry the argument into the
theological domain by reasoning as follows: What is
true in the natural must be equally true in the supernatural
sphere, as we know from reason and Revelation.<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
e) To physical predetermination or premotion in the
order of nature, there corresponds in the supernatural
sphere the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>, which
predetermines man to perform salutary acts in such wise that he acts freely but
at the same time with metaphysical necessity
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate consequentiae</span></span>, not
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">consequentis</span></span>). It would be a contradiction
to say that efficacious grace given for the purpose
of eliciting consent may co-exist with non-consent,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, may fail to elicit consent.<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href="#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a> The will freely assents
to the divine impulse because it is effectively moved
thereto by grace. Consequently, efficacious grace does
not derive its efficacy from the consent of the will; it is
efficacious of itself and intrinsically
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax ab
intrinseco sive per se</span></span>).<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href="#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It follows that efficacious grace must be conceived as
a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedeterminatio ad
unum</span></span>.<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719" href="#note_719"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
f) If efficacious grace is intrinsically and of its very
nature inseparably bound up with the consent of the
will, it must differ essentially from merely sufficient
grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia mere sufficiens</span></span>), which
confers only the power to act (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">posse
operari</span></span>), not the act itself (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actu
operari</span></span>). Efficacious grace, by its very definition, includes
the free consent of the will, while merely sufficient
grace lacks that consent, because with it, it would
cease to be merely sufficient and would become efficacious.<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href="#note_720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here the question naturally arises: How, in this hypothesis,
can sufficient grace be called truly sufficient?
The Thomists answer this question in different ways.
Gazzaniga says that sufficient grace confers the power
to perform a good deed, but that something more is required

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Critical Estimate of the Thomistic
Theory.</span></span>—The Thomistic system undoubtedly has
its merits. It is logical in its deductions, exalts
divine grace as the prime factor in the business of
salvation, and magnificently works out the concept
of God as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa prima</span></span>
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motor primus</span></span>
both in the natural and the supernatural order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Thomism also has its weak points.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A. The Thomistic conception of efficacious
grace is open to two serious theological difficulties.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) To draw an intrinsic and substantial distinction
between efficacious and merely sufficient
grace destroys the true notion of sufficient grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) The Thomistic theory of efficacious grace
is incompatible with the dogma of free-will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though in theory the Thomists defend the
sufficiency of grace and the freedom of the will
as valiantly as their opponents, they fail in their
attempts at squaring these dogmas with the
fundamental principles of their system.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Sufficient grace, as conceived by the Thomists,
is not truly sufficient to enable a man to perform
a salutary act, because <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex vi
notionis</span></span> it confers
merely the power to act, postulating for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the act itself a substantially new grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
efficax</span></span>). A grace which requires to be entitatively
supplemented by another, in order to enable
a man to perform a salutary act, is clearly not
sufficient for the performance of that act. <span class="tei tei-q">“To be
truly sufficient for something”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“to require to
be complemented by something else”</span> are mutually
exclusive notions, and hence <span class="tei tei-q">“sufficient
grace”</span> as conceived by Thomists is in reality insufficient.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many subtle explanations have been devised to obviate
this difficulty. Billuart and nearly all the later Thomists
say that if any one who has received sufficient grace (in
the Thomistic sense of the term) is denied the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
efficax</span></span>, it must be attributed to a sinful resistance of the
will.<a id="noteref_724" name="noteref_724" href="#note_724"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">724</span></span></a> But this explanation is incompatible with the
Thomistic teaching that together with the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
sufficiens</span></span> there co-exists in the soul of the sinner an irresistible
and inevitable <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio physica</span></span> to the
entity of sin, with which entity formal sin is inseparably bound
up.<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href="#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> If this be true, how can the will of
man be held responsible so long as God denies him the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia ab intrinseco efficax</span></span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Speaking in the abstract, the will may assume one of
three distinct attitudes toward sufficient grace. It may
consent, it may resist, or it may remain neutral. It cannot
consent except with the aid of a predetermining
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>, to merit which is beyond its
power. If it withstands, it <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span> renders
itself unworthy of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
efficax</span></span>. If it takes a neutral attitude, (which may in
itself be a sinful act), and awaits efficacious grace, of
what use is sufficient grace?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To resist sufficient grace involves an abuse of liberty.
Now, where does the right use of liberty come in? If coöperation
with sufficient grace moves God to bestow the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia per se efficax</span></span>, as the Thomists
contend, then the right use of liberty must lie somewhere between the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sufficiens</span></span> and the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax per se</span></span>. But there is absolutely
no place for it in the Thomistic system. The
right use of liberty for the purpose of obtaining efficacious
grace is attributable either to grace or to unaided nature.
To assert that it is the work of unaided nature
would lead to Semipelagianism. To hold that it is owing
to grace would be moving in a vicious circle, thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Because
the will offers no resistance, it is efficaciously moved
to perform a salutary act; that it offers no sinful resistance
is owing to the fact that it is efficaciously moved to perform
a salutary act.”</span><a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href="#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is impossible to devise any satisfactory solution of
this difficulty which will not at the same time upset the
very foundation on which the Thomistic system rests,
viz.: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nulla secunda
causa potest operari, nisi sit efficaciter
determinata a prima [scil. per applicationem potentiae
ad actum]</span></span>,”</span> that is to say, no secondary cause can
act unless it be efficaciously determined by the First Cause
by an application of the latter to the former as of potency
to act.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The Thomistic <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>, conceived as
a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedeterminatio ad unum</span></span>, inevitably
destroys free-will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) It is important to state the question clearly: Not
physical premotion as such,<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727" href="#note_727"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">727</span></span></a> but the implied connotation
of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praevia determinatio ad unum</span></span>, is
incompatible with the dogma of free-will. The freedom of the will does
not consist in the pure contingency of an act, or in a
merely passive indifference, but in active indifference
either to will or not to will, to will thus or otherwise.
Consequently every physical predetermination, in so far
as it is a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">determinatio ad unum</span></span>, must
necessarily be destructive of free-will. Self-determination and physical
predetermination by an extraneous will are mutually exclusive.
Now the Thomists hold that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia per se
efficax</span></span> operates in the manner of a supernatural
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedeterminatio
ad unum</span></span>. If this were true, the will under the
influence of efficacious grace would no longer be free.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To perceive the full force of this argument it is necessary
to keep in mind the Thomistic definition of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio
physica</span></span> as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actio Dei, quâ voluntatem
humanam, priusquam se determinet, ita ad actum movet insuperabili
virtute, ut voluntas nequeat omissionem sui actus
cum illa praemotione coniungere</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_728" name="noteref_728" href="#note_728"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> That is to say:
As the non-performance of an act by the will is owing
simply and solely to the absence of the respective
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio
physica</span></span>, so conversely, the performance of an act
is conditioned simply and solely by the presence of a divine
premotion; the will itself can neither obtain nor prevent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such a premotion, because this would require a new premotion,
which again depends entirely on the divine pleasure.
If the will of man were thus inevitably predetermined
by God, it could not in any sense of the term be
called truly free.
</p>

<div class="tei tei-tb"><hr style="width: 50%" /></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) The Thomists meet this argument with mere evasions.
They make a distinction between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas
consequentis</span></span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">antecedens</span></span>), which
really necessitates, and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas
consequentiae</span></span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">subsequens</span></span>), which
does not. A free act, they say, necessarily proceeds from a physical
premotion, but it is not on that account in itself
necessary. But, we answer, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">determinatio ad
unum</span></span>, which precedes a free act and is independent of the will, is
more than a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas consequentiae</span></span>—it
is a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas
consequentis</span></span> destructive of free-will. The Thomists
reply: Considered as a created entity, physical premotion
may indeed be incompatible with free-will; not
so if regarded as an act of God, who, being almighty, is
able to predetermine the will without prejudice to its
freedom.<a id="noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href="#note_729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> The obvious rejoinder is that
an intrinsic contradiction cannot be solved by an appeal to the divine
omnipotence, because even God Himself cannot do what
is intrinsically impossible.<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> He can no more change a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">determinatio ad unum</span></span> into a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">libertas ad utrumque</span></span> than
He can create a square circle, because the two notions
involve an intrinsic contradiction. Furthermore, if the
Almighty wished intrinsically to compel a man to perform
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some definite act, would He not choose precisely that
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio physica</span></span> which, the Thomists claim,
also produces free acts? Not so, replies Alvarez; <span class="tei tei-q">“for the will
remains free so long as the intellect represents to it an
object as indifferent.”</span><a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> That is to say: Liberty remains
as long as its root, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> an indifferent judgment, is present.
But this new rejoinder, far from solving the riddle,
simply begs the question. Liberty of choice resides
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formaliter</span></span> in the will, not in the intellect,
and consequently the will, as will, cannot be truly free unless it
possesses within itself the unimpeded power to act or not to act.
This <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferentia activa ad utrumlibet</span></span>,
as it is technically termed, is absolutely incompatible with the
Thomistic <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio ad unum</span></span>. What
would it avail the will to enjoy the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferentia
iudicii</span></span> if it had to submit
to compulsion from some other quarter?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
γ) To escape from this quandary the Thomists resort
to the famous distinction between the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus
compositus</span></span> and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus divisus</span></span>.
The Molinists argue: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Liberum
arbitrium efficaciter praemotum a gratia non potest
dissentire; ergo non est liberum.</span></span>”</span> The Thomists reply:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Distinguo:—non potest dissentire in sensu
diviso, nego; non potest dissentire in sensu composito,
concedo.</span></span>”</span> They explain this distinction by certain well-known
examples taken from dialectics. Thus Billuart
says: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ut si dicas, sedens potest stare, significat in
sensu composito, quod possit sedere simul et stare; ...
in sensu diviso, quod sedens sub sessione retinet potentiam
standi, non tamen componendi stationem cum
sessione. Uno verbo: sensus compositus importat potentiam
simultaneitatis, sensus divisus simultaneitatem
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
potentiae.</span></span>”</span><a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> As one who sits cannot at the same time
stand (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus compositus</span></span>), although he
is free to rise (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus divisus</span></span>),
so the consent of the will effected by efficacious grace, cannot become dissent
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus compositus</span></span>),
though the will retains the power to dissent instead
of consenting (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus divisus</span></span>),
and this is sufficient to safeguard its freedom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is the distinction between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus compositus</span></span>
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus divisus</span></span> correctly applied here? Can
the will, under the predetermining influence of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>,
change its consent into dissent at any time and as easily
as a man who is sitting on a chair can rise and thereby
demonstrate that his sitting was an absolutely free act?
Alvarez<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a>
describes the Thomistic <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia dissentiendi</span></span>
as a faculty which can never under any circumstances become
active. But such a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span> is really no
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span> at
all. A man tied to a chair is not free to stand; his natural
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia standi</span></span>
is neutralized by external restraint.
Similarly, the will, under the influence of the Thomistic
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>,
no longer enjoys the power to dissent,
and the alleged <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia resistendi</span></span>,
by which the Thomists
claim to save free-will, is a chimera.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
δ) It is at this decisive point in the controversy that
the Molinists triumphantly bring in the declaration of the
Council of Trent that <span class="tei tei-q">“man ... while he receives that
inspiration [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> efficacious grace], ... is also able
to reject it.”</span> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one saith that man's
free-will, moved and excited by God, by assenting to
God exciting and calling, does in no wise coöperate towards
disposing and preparing itself for obtaining the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grace of justification; that it cannot refuse its consent
if it would, but that, as something inanimate, it does
nothing whatever and is merely passive; let him be anathema.”</span><a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a>
To adjust their system to this important
dogmatic decision, the older Thomists claimed that the
Tridentine Council had in mind merely the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sufficiens</span></span>,
to which the will can refuse its consent. But this
interpretation is untenable. The Council plainly refers
to that grace with which the will coöperates by giving
its consent (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cooperatur
assentiendo</span></span>) and which it can
render inefficacious by withdrawing its consent, in other
words, with the grace which disposes and prepares a sinner
for justification, and under the influence of which,
according to Luther and Calvin, the will remains inanimate
and merely passive. This can only be the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
efficax</span></span>. Other Thomist theologians, not daring to contradict
the obvious sense of the Tridentine decree, assert that
the Council intentionally chose the term
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dissentire</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus
divisus</span></span>) rather than <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">resistere</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sensus compositus</span></span>), in
order to indicate that under the predetermining influence
of grace it is possible for the will to refuse its consent
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">posse dissentire</span></span>)
but not to offer resistance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">posse
resistere</span></span>).<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a>
This interpretation is no longer tenable
since the Vatican Council has defined that <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith, even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when it does not work by charity, is in itself a gift
of God, and the act of faith is a work appertaining to
salvation, by which man yields voluntary obedience to
God Himself, by assenting to and coöperating with His
grace, which he is able to resist.”</span><a id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> If efficacious grace
can be successfully resisted, it can not possess that <span class="tei tei-q">“irresistible”</span>
influence which the Thomists ascribe to it.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href="#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a>

B. The Thomistic system is open to two serious
objections also from the philosophical point

b) A more serious objection than the one
just adverted to is that the Thomistic hypothesis
involves the blasphemous inference that God
predetermines men to sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) Under a rigorous application of the Thomistic principles
God would have to be acknowledged as the cause
of sin. As the predetermination of the will to justification
can take no other form than the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia per se efficax</span></span>,
so sin, considered as an act, necessarily postulates the
predetermining influence of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motor
primus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href="#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> Without
this assumption it would be impossible in the Thomistic
system to find in the absolute will of God an infallible
medium by which He can foreknow future sins.
Bañez says on this point: <span class="tei tei-q">“God knows sin with an intuitive
knowledge, because His will is the cause of the
sinful act, as act, at the same time permitting free-will
to concur in that act by failing to observe the law.”</span><a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href="#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a>
Though the Thomists refuse to admit that God Himself
is the immediate author of sin, the conclusion is inevitable
from their premises. And this for two reasons. First,
because the alleged <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio ad malum</span></span> is
as irresistible as the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio ad bonum</span></span>;
and secondly, because the material element of sin must be inseparable from its formal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
element; otherwise God would foreknow sin merely
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">materialiter</span></span>
as an act but not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formaliter</span></span> as a sin. The
teaching of the Church on this point was clearly defined
by the Council of Trent: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one saith that it is
not in man's power to make his ways evil, but that the
works that are evil God worketh as well as those that
are good, not permissibly only, but properly and of Himself,
in such wise that the treason of Judas is no less
His own proper work than the vocation of Paul; let him
be anathema.”</span><a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If the rational creature were compelled to perform
a sinful act, as act, resistance would be impossible. And
if it were true that the malice of an act practically cannot
be separated from its physical entity, then in the Thomistic
hypothesis God would be the author not only of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">entitas</span></span>
but likewise of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malitia peccati</span></span>. The devil
tempts us only by moral means, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> by suggestion; are
we to assume that God tempts us physically by inducing
sin as an act and simultaneously withholding the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio
ad bonum</span></span>, thus making sin an inevitable fatality?
This consideration may be supplemented by another.
So-called <span class="tei tei-q">“sins of malice”</span> are comparatively rare.
Most sins are committed for the sake of some pleasure
or imaginary advantage. It is for this reason that moral
theology in forbidding sin forbids its physical entity.
How gladly would not those who are addicted to impurity,
for instance, separate the malice from the entity of their
sinful acts, in order to be enabled to indulge their passion
without offending God!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Against the logic of this argument some Thomist
theologians defend themselves by a simile. The soul of a
lame man, they say, enables him indeed to move his disabled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
limb; however, the cause of limping is not the soul
but a crooked shinbone. Father Pesch wittily disposes
of such reasoning as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The will of Adam before
the fall was not a crooked shinbone, but it was absolutely straight, and became crooked
through physical premotion.”</span><a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href="#note_742"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another and more plausible contention of the Thomist
school is that Molinism, too, is compelled to ascribe sin
somehow to God. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is impossible for a man to sin
unless God lends His coöperation. Do not, therefore,
the Molinists also make God the author of sin?”</span> Those
who argue in this wise overlook the fact that there is a
very large distinction between the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus simultaneus</span></span>
of the Molinists and the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio physica</span></span> of the Thomists.
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio physica</span></span> predetermines the sinful
act without regard to the circumstance whether or not the
will is able to offer resistance. The
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus simultaneus</span></span>,
on the other hand, begins as a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus
oblatus</span></span>, which is in itself indifferent and awaits as it were
the free consent of the will before it coöperates with the
sinner as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concursus collatus</span></span>
in the performance of the sinful
act.<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> For this reason the distinction between
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">malitia</span></span> has a well-defined place in the
Molinistic system, whereas it is meaningless in that of the
Thomists.<a id="noteref_744" name="noteref_744" href="#note_744"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Augustinianism</span></span>.—This system, so called
because its defenders pretend to base it on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
authority of St. Augustine, has some points of
similarity with Thomism but differs from the
latter in more than one respect, especially in this
that the Augustinians,<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href="#note_745"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a> though they speak with
great deference of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia per se efficax</span></span>,
hold that the will is not physically but only morally
predetermined in its free acts. Hence Augustinianism
may fitly be described as the system of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praedeterminatio moralis</span></span>. Its most eminent
defender is Lawrence Berti, O. S. A. (1696-1766),
who in a voluminous work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Theologicis
Disciplinis</span></span><a id="noteref_746" name="noteref_746" href="#note_746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a>
so vigorously championed the Augustinian
theory that Archbishop Jean d'Yse de Saléon,
of Vienne,<a id="noteref_747" name="noteref_747" href="#note_747"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">747</span></span></a> and other contemporary theologians
combated his teaching as a revival of Jansenism.
Pope Benedict XIV instituted an official investigation,
which resulted in a decree permitting
Augustinianism to be freely held and taught.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Whereas Thomism begins with the concept of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa
prima</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motor primus</span></span>,
Augustinianism is based on the notion of
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis</span></span> or
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>. Berti holds
three principles in common with Jansenius: (1) Actual
grace consists essentially in the infusion of celestial
delectation. (2) This heavenly delectation (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
grace) causally precedes free-will in such wise that its
relative intensity in every instance constitutes the law
and standard of the will's disposition to do good.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) Simultaneously with this celestial delectation, concupiscence
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio carnalis, concupiscentia</span></span>)
is doing its work in fallen man, and the two powers constantly contend
for the mastery. So long as celestial delectation
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> grace) is weaker than, or equipollent with, concupiscence,
the will inevitably fails to perform the salutary
act to which it is invited by the former. It is
only when the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis</span></span>
overcomes concupiscence
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis victrix</span></span>)
that free-will can perform
the act inspired by grace. There is a fourth principle,
and one, too, of fundamental importance, which
brings out the essential difference between Augustinianism
and Jansenism, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis</span></span> never
overpowers the will but leaves it free to choose between
good and evil.<a id="noteref_748" name="noteref_748" href="#note_748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The relation between merely sufficient and efficacious
grace in the Augustinian system, therefore, may be
described as follows: Merely sufficient grace imparts to
the will the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">posse</span></span>
but not the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">velle</span></span>, or at best only such
a weak <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">velle</span></span> that it requires the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio victrix</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>)
to become effective. Efficacious grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio
coelestis victrix</span></span>), on the other hand, impels the will actually
to perform the good deed. Hence there is between
the two an essential and specific difference, and the
efficacy of that grace which leads to the performance of
salutary acts does not lie with free-will but depends on the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis</span></span>, which must consequently
be conceived as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax ab
intrinseco sive per se</span></span>.<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Nevertheless, the necessity of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
efficax ab
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
intrinseco</span></span>, according to the Augustinian theory, is not
due to the subordination of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa secunda</span></span>
to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa prima</span></span>, as the Thomists contend,
but to a constitutional
weakness of human nature, consisting in this
that its evil impulses can be overcome solely by the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio coelestis victrix</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax, adiutorium
quo</span></span>. The case was different before the Fall, when
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia versatilis</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia sufficiens, adiutorium sine
quo non</span></span>) sufficed for the performance of salutary
acts.<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750" href="#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">750</span></span></a>

d) However, the Augustinians insist against the Jansenists,
that the delectatio <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">coelestis</span></span>
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> efficacious
grace) does not intrinsically compel the will, but acts
merely as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio moralis</span></span>,
and that while the will obeys the inspiration of grace infallibly
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">infallibiliter</span></span>) it
does not do so necessarily (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">non necessario</span></span>).
With equal certainty, though not necessarily, the will, when equipped
solely with sufficient grace, succumbs to concupiscence.
The ultimate reason for the freedom of the will is to be
found in the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">indifferentia
iudicii</span></span>.<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href="#note_751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a> By way of exemplification
the Augustinians cite the case of a well-bred man

never turn summersaults on a public thoroughfare or

notice only in so far as it claims to base its teaching
on St. Augustine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like the Bible, the writings of that holy Doctor have

If the use of Augustinian terms guaranteed the possession
of Augustinian ideas, Jansenius would have a strong claim
to be considered a faithful disciple of St. Augustine.
Yet how widely does not the <span class="tei tei-q">“Augustinus Iprensis,”</span> as
he has been called, differ from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Augustinus Hipponensis”</span>!
Augustinianism, too, utterly misconceives the
terms which it employs. Space permits us to call attention
to one or two points only.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) In the first place Augustinianism labors under
an absolutely false conception of sufficient
grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How can that grace be sufficient for justification which
is first described in glowing colors as
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">parva et invalida</span></span> and
then in the same breath is declared to be insufficient except
when reinforced by a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia magna</span></span>
in the shape of <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio
victrix</span></span>? What kind of <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> can that be which
in its very nature is so constituted that the will, under
the prevailing influence of concupiscence, infallibly does
the opposite of that to which it is supernaturally impelled?
It is quite true that the distinction between
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia parva</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
However, he understands by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia parva</span></span>
not sufficient grace, but the grace of prayer
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia remote sufficiens</span></span>),
and by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia magna</span></span>, not efficacious grace as
such, but grace sufficient to perform a good act (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
proxime sufficiens</span></span>).<a id="noteref_754" name="noteref_754" href="#note_754"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">754</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Augustinianism is unable to reconcile its
theory of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">praemotio moralis</span></span> with the dogma of
free-will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Under the Augustinian system the influence of efficacious
grace can be conceived in but two ways. Either
it is so strong that the will is physically unable to withhold
its consent; or it is only strong enough that the
consent of the will can be inferred with purely moral
certainty. In the former alternative we have a prevenient
necessity which determines the will <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad unum</span></span>
and consequently destroys its freedom. In the latter, there can be
no infallible foreknowledge of the future free acts of rational
creatures on the part of God, because the Augustinians
reject the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span> of the Molinists
and expressly admit that the same grace which proves effective
in one man remains ineffective in another because of the
condition of his heart.<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755" href="#note_755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Finally, the three fundamental principles of
the Augustinian system are false and have no
warrant in the writings of St. Augustine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not true that pleasure (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">delectatio</span></span>) is
the font and well-spring of all supernaturally good deeds. Such deeds may also be
inspired by hatred, fear, sorrow, etc.<a id="noteref_756" name="noteref_756" href="#note_756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">756</span></span></a> With
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
many men the fear of God or a sense of duty is as strong
an incentive to do good as the sweet consciousness of
treading the right path. St. Augustine did not regard
<span class="tei tei-q">“celestial delectation”</span> as the essential mark of efficacious grace, nor
concupiscence as the characteristic note of sin.<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757" href="#note_757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">757</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second and third principles of the Augustinian system
are likewise false. If delectation is only one motive
among many, its varying intensity cannot be the standard
of our conduct; and still less can it be said that the
will is morally compelled in each instance to obey the relatively
stronger as against the weaker delectation; for any
necessitation that does not depend on the free will excludes
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">libertas a coactione</span></span>,
but not that <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">libertas a necessitate</span></span>
which constitutes the notion of liberty. There
can be no freedom of the will unless the will is able to
resist delectation at all times. Consequently, the fourth
principle of the Augustinians, by which they pretend to
uphold free-will, is also false.<a id="noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The point in which these two systems meet,
and in regard to which they differ from Thomism
and Augustinianism, is the definition of efficacious
grace as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficax ab extrinseco sive per
accidens</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This conception was violently attacked by the Spanish
Dominican Bañez and other divines. About 1594,
the controversy between the followers of Bañez and the
Molinists waxed so hot that Pope Clement VIII appointed
a special commission to settle it. This was the
famous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Congregatio de Auxiliis</span></span>, consisting of picked
theologians from both the Dominican and the Jesuit orders.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It debated the matter for nine full years without
arriving at a decision. Finally Pope Paul V, at the suggestion
of St. Francis de Sales, declared both systems to
be orthodox and defensible, and strictly forbade the contending
parties to denounce each other as heretical.<a id="noteref_759" name="noteref_759" href="#note_759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">759</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While Thomism devoted its efforts mainly to the defense
of grace, Molinism made it its chief business to
champion the dogma of free-will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Molinism.</span></span>—Molinism takes its name from
the Jesuit Luis de Molina, who published a famous
treatise under the title <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Concordia Liberi Arbitrii
cum Gratiae Donis</span></span> at Lisbon, in 1588. His
teaching may be outlined as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) In <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actu primo</span></span> there is no intrinsic and
ontological but merely an extrinsic and accidental distinction between
efficacious and sufficient grace, based upon their respective
effects. Sufficient grace becomes efficacious by the consent
of the will; if the will resists, grace remains inefficacious
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inefficax</span></span>) and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">merely</span></em> sufficient
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia mere sufficiens</span></span>).
Consequently, one and the same grace may be
efficacious in one case and inefficacious in another. It all
depends on the will.<a id="noteref_760" name="noteref_760" href="#note_760"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">760</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) This theory involves no denial of the priority and
superior dignity of grace in the work of salvation. The
will, considered as a mere faculty, and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu primo</span></span>, is
raised to the supernatural order by prevenient grace
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia praeveniens</span></span>),
which imparts to it all the moral
and physical power necessary to perform free salutary
acts. Neither can the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus secundus</span></span> be regarded as a
product of the unaided will; it is the result of grace coöperating
with free-will.<a id="noteref_761" name="noteref_761" href="#note_761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">761</span></span></a>
Consequently, the will by giving
its consent does not increase the power of grace, but
it is grace which makes possible, prepares, and aids the
will in performing free acts. To say that the influence of
grace goes farther than this would be to assert that it acts
independently of the will, and would thereby deny the
freedom of the latter.<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762" href="#note_762"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">762</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The infallibility with which efficacious grace works
its effects is to be explained not by God's absolute will,
but by His infallible foreknowledge through the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia
media</span></span>,—a Molinistic postulate which was first defined
and scientifically demonstrated by Father Fonseca, S. J.,
the teacher of Suarez.<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href="#note_763"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> God foreknows not only the
absolutely free acts (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">futura</span></span>)
of His rational creatures
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia visionis</span></span>,
but likewise their hypothetically free acts
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">futuribilia</span></span>)
by means of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span>,
and hence He infallibly knows from all eternity what
attitude the free-will of man would assume in each case
if grace were given him. Consequently, when God, in
the light of this eternal foreknowledge, actually bestows
a grace, this grace will prove efficacious or
inefficacious according as He has foreknown whether
the will will give or withhold its consent. Thus can the
infallibility of efficacious grace be reconciled with the
dogma of free-will without prejudice to such other dogmas
as final perseverance and the predestination of the
elect, because God by virtue of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span> has it
absolutely in His power to give or withhold His graces
in each individual case.<a id="noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="#note_764"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Critical Estimate of Molinism.</span></span>—Even the
most determined opponents of Molinism admit
that this system possesses three important advantages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) First, it gives a satisfactory account of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sufficiency of <span class="tei tei-q">“merely sufficient grace,”</span> which
in its physical nature does not differ essentially
from efficacious grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Second, Molinism safeguards free-will by denying
that efficacious grace either physically or morally
predetermines the will to one course of action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Third, Molinism explains in a fairly satisfactory
manner why efficacious grace is infallibly
efficacious. God in virtue of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span>
knows with metaphysical certainty from all
eternity which graces in each individual case
will prove efficacious through the free consent of
the will and which will remain inefficacious, and
is thereby enabled to bestow or withhold grace
according to His absolute decrees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The question may justly be raised, however,
whether, in endeavoring to safeguard freewill,
the Molinists do not undervalue grace, which
is after all the primary and decisive factor in
the work of salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is something incongruous in the notion that
the efficacy or inefficacy of divine grace should depend on
the arbitrary pleasure of a created will. If sufficient
grace does not become efficacious except by the consent of
the will, how can the resultant salutary act be said to be an
effect of grace? St. Paul, St. Augustine, and the councils
of the Church do not say: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus
facit, si volumus</span></span>,”</span> but they declare:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus facit, ut faciamus</span></span>,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus ipse dat ipsum velle et facere
et perficere</span></span>,”</span> and so forth. What can this mean if not:
Divine grace need not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
concern itself with external circumstances, occasions,
humors, etc., but it takes hold of the sinner and actually
converts him, without regard to anything except the decree
of the Divine Will. On account of this and similar
difficulties Cardinal Bellarmine, who was a champion and
protector of P. Molina, seems to have rejected Molinism<a id="noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href="#note_765"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a>
in favor of Congruism.<a id="noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href="#note_766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The same reasons that induced Bellarmine
to embrace Congruism probably led the Jesuit
General Claudius Aquaviva, in 1613, to order
all teachers of theology in the Society to lay
greater emphasis on the Congruistic element in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the notion of efficacious grace. This measure
was quite in harmony with the principles defended
by the Jesuit members of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Congregatio
de Auxiliis</span></span> before Clement VIII and Paul V.
Aquaviva's order is of sufficient importance to
deserve a place in the text of this volume: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Nostri
in posterum omnino doceant, inter eam gratiam
quae effectum re ipsâ habet atque efficax dicitur,
et eam quam sufficientem nominant, non tantum
discrimen esse in actu secundo, quia ex usu liberi
arbitrii etiam cooperantem gratiam habentis
effectum sortiatur, altera non item; sed in ipso
actu primo, quod positâ scientiâ conditionalium
[scientiâ mediâ] ex efficaci Dei proposito atque
intentione efficiendi certissime in nobis boni, de
industria ipse ea media seligit atque eo modo et
tempore confert, quo videt effectum, infallibiliter
habitura, aliis usurus, si haec inefficacia praevidisset.
Quare semper moraliter et in ratione beneficii
plus aliquid in efficaci, quam in sufficienti
gratia est, in actu primo contineri: atque hac ratione
efficere Deum, ut re ipsâ faciamus, non tantum
quia dat gratiam quâ facere possimus. Quod
idem dicendum est de perseverantia, quae procul
dubio donum est.</span></span>”</span> This modified, or perhaps we
had better say, more sharply determined form
of Molinism is called Congruism.<a id="noteref_767" name="noteref_767" href="#note_767"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Congruism.</span></span>—The system thus recommended
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by Aquaviva in its fundamental principles
really originated with Molina himself. It was
developed by the great Jesuit theologians Suarez,
Vasquez, and Lessius, and became the official
system of the Society of Jesus under Muzio
Vitelleschi (d. 1645) and Piccolomini (d. 1651).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The distinction between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia congrua</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia incongrua</span></span> is founded on the writings
of St. Augustine, who speaks of the elect as
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">congruenter
vocati</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768" href="#note_768"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a> The
Congruists maintain against the extreme Molinists that
the efficacy of grace is not attributable solely to a free determination
of the will, but, at least in part, to the fact
that grace is bestowed under circumstances favorable
to its operation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“congruous”</span> in that sense. When
the circumstances are comparatively adverse
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">incongrua</span></span>),
grace remains merely sufficient. A prudent father
who knows how to govern his children without physical
force will speak the right word to each at the proper
time. Similarly God adapts His grace, if it is to prove
efficacious, to the circumstances of each individual case,
thereby attaining His purpose without fail. Thus the
reckless youth on the city streets needs more powerful
graces than the pious nun in her secluded convent cell,
because he is exposed to stronger temptations and his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
environment is unfavorable to religious influences. Since
grace is conferred with a wise regard to temperament,
character, inclinations, prejudices, time and place,
there exists between it and free-will a sort of intrinsic
affinity, which in the hands of God becomes an infallible
means of executing His decrees.<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href="#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The actual bestowal of congruous grace, considered
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu primo</span></span>,
is undoubtedly a special gift of God,
and hence the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia congrua</span></span>
possesses a higher value than the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia incongrua sive inefficax</span></span>.
An entitatively
weaker impulse of grace, if conferred under comparatively
favorable conditions, is more precious than a
stronger impulse which fails in its purpose by reason
of unfavorable circumstances created by inclination, training,
or environment. Little David accomplished more
with a handful of pebbles in his scrip than had he been
heavily armed.<a id="noteref_770" name="noteref_770" href="#note_770"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">770</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Congruism assigns a far more important rôle to
grace than extreme Molinism. It makes the will depend
on efficacious grace, not the efficacy of grace upon the
will. Bellarmine illustrates this difference by the example
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a sermon which, under an entirely equal distribution
of internal grace, converts one sinner while it leaves
another untouched.<a id="noteref_771" name="noteref_771" href="#note_771"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">771</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Critical Estimate of Congruism.</span></span>—Among
the different systems devised for the purpose of
harmonizing the dogmas of grace and free-will,
Congruism probably comes nearest the truth. It
strikes a golden mean between the two extremes
of Pelagianism and Semipelagianism on the one
hand, and Calvinism and Jansenism on the other,
and its principal theses can be supported by clear
and unmistakable passages from the writings of
St. Augustine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Other points in its favor are the following:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sufficient grace,”</span> in the Congruist hypothesis, is
truly sufficient so far as God is concerned, because
its inefficaciousness is attributable solely
to the human will. That free-will is properly
safeguarded under the influence of efficacious
grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia congrua</span></span>) is admitted even by
theologians of the opposing schools. True, Congruism
does not regard the will as an abstract
notion, but as a factor closely interwoven with the
concrete circumstances of daily life. As favorable
circumstances (education, association, temperament)
merely influence the will but do not
compel it, so supernatural grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia congrua
s. efficax</span></span>) may soften the will and occasionally

good. Congruism marks a distinct advance over
extreme Molinism also in this, that it bases the
difference between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">congrua</span></span>) and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia inefficax</span></span>
not entirely on the will of man,
but likewise on the will of God, whereby it is able
to explain such formulas as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus facit,

<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus est, qui discernit</span></span>,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">etc.</span></span>, in a manner
entirely compatible with the dogmatic teaching of
the Church.<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href="#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">modus operandi</span></span>
of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia congrua</span></span> (efficacious
grace) is explained by Congruism, in
common with Molinism, as follows: There is a
threefold efficacy: the efficacy of power (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficacia
virtutis</span></span>), the efficacy of union
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficacia connexionis</span></span>),
and the efficacy of infallible success
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficacia infallibilitatis</span></span>).
Grace (both efficacious
and sufficient) does not derive its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficacia
virtutis</span></span> from the free-will of man, nor from the
knowledge of God (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span>), but from
itself. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficacia connexionis</span></span>
(of union between act and grace) on the other hand, depends
entirely on the free-will, since, according to the
Council of Trent as well as that of the Vatican,
efficacious grace does not operate irresistibly but
can be <span class="tei tei-q">“cast off.”</span> The
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">efficacia infallibilitatis</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
springs from God's certain foreknowledge
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span>),
which cannot be deceived.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href="#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Nevertheless, it would be unreasonable to contend
that Congruism solves all difficulties. The mystery surrounding
both the unequal distribution of efficacious grace
and the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span> still remains.
Moreover, the theory that God adjusts himself slavishly to all the circumstances
of His creatures, can hardly be reconciled with
His dignity and omnipotence. It would no doubt be far
worthier of His majesty to seize upon the free will of
man and compel it to perform the salutary act which He
wishes it to perform. Whoever has studied the lives of
saints and eminent converts knows that the sudden and
seemingly unaccountable changes of heart which many of
them have experienced can hardly be regarded as miracles
in the strict sense, though on the other hand it seems certain
that grace worked in them with little or no regard to
the <span class="tei tei-q">“congruity”</span> of circumstances. Again, it is one of
the highest and most sublime missions of grace not to
be balked by unfavorable circumstances but to re-shape
them by changing a man's temperament, dulling concupiscence,
weakening the power of temptation, and so
forth. In other words, grace does not depend on but
controls and fashions the circumstances of the recipient.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After all is said, therefore, the relation of grace and
free-will still remains an unsolved mystery.<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href="#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a>

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Syncretism.</span></span>—Seeing that each of the different
systems which we so far reviewed contains
grains of truth, some theologians<a id="noteref_776" name="noteref_776" href="#note_776"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a> have adopted
the good points of all four and combined them
into a fifth, called Syncretism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These authors begin by assuming the existence of two
quite distinct sorts of efficacious grace, the (Thomistic-Augustinian)
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax ab intrinseco</span></span>, and the
(Molinistic-Congruistic) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax ab
extrinseco</span></span>. The former,
they contend, is bestowed for the performance of
more difficult good works, such as resisting grievous temptations,
observing onerous precepts, exercising patience
in severe tribulation, etc.; while the latter enables man
to accomplish less difficult acts, such as short prayers,
slight mortifications, etc. The connecting link between
the two is prayer, which has been instituted for the purpose
of enabling man to obtain that <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax ab
intrinseco</span></span> which is necessary for the performance of the
more difficult works of salvation. Sacred Scripture
teaches that prayer originates in grace, that it is binding
upon all men, and that it accomplishes its purpose infallibly.<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href="#note_777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Critical Estimate of Syncretism.</span></span>—The
outstanding characteristic of Syncretism is its
insistence on prayer as a highly important, not to
say the most important, factor in the work of
salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) In this the Syncretistic school is undoubtedly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
right. Sacred Scripture and Tradition both
strongly emphasize the importance and necessity
of prayer, so much so that one naturally expects
to find prayer playing an essential and indispensable
rôle in every complete and orthodox
system of grace. <span class="tei tei-q">“The present economy of grace
is essentially and intrinsically an economy of
prayer,”</span> is a theological axiom which cannot
be too strongly insisted upon. To have brought
out this great truth forcibly and luminously is the
merit of Syncretism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) We do not mean to intimate, however, that the
Syncretistic theory has solved the problem of the relation
between free-will and grace. On the contrary, by adopting
two such heterogeneous concepts as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax
ab intrinseco</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax ab
extrinseco</span></span> it has actually
increased the difficulties found in the other systems.
For now we are put before the dilemma:—the Thomistic
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span> either supposes free-will or
it does not: if it does, there is no reason to limit this grace
to the more difficult works of salvation; if it does
not, then the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia efficax</span></span> can be of no
assistance in the performance of more difficult works, because these too,
to be meritorious, require the coöperation of free-will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Syncretists try to evade this dilemma by contending
that prayer, as the connecting link, communicates its
own liberty and meritoriousness to the salutary acts performed
through its agency, in other words, that these
acts are the effect of prayer
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">effectus orationis</span></span>). But
aside from the fact that prayer itself is quite often a
difficult act, the more arduous works of salvation would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the Syncretist hypothesis be stripped of their meritoriousness
and degraded to the level of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">voluntarium
in causa</span></span>, which is an untenable assumption.<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href="#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a>
Finally, there is something illogical and unsatisfactory
in admitting on equal terms, as it were, two such incompatible
notions as the Thomistic <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cognitio Dei in decretis
praedeterminantibus</span></span> and the Molinistic
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">scientia media</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus in the end all attempts to harmonize the dogmas
of grace and free-will fail to solve the mystery, and we
are compelled to exclaim with St. Paul: <span class="tei tei-q">“O the depth
of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of
God! How incomprehensible are His judgments, and
how unsearchable His ways!”</span><a id="noteref_779" name="noteref_779" href="#note_779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a>

it where it already exists.

Process Of Justification</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The justification of an adult human being does
not take place suddenly, but runs through certain
well-defined stages, which in their totality are
called the process of justification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Being a <span class="tei tei-q">“regeneration in God,”</span> justification
bears a striking resemblance to the development
of the fœtus in the maternal womb. Like physical
birth, spiritual regeneration is preceded by
travailing, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> fear and painful contrition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dogmatic teaching of the Catholic Church
on justification is formally defined by the Tridentine
Council, whose decrees<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Lutheran Heresy vs. the Teaching
of the Church.</span></span>—The Protestant Reformers,
notably Luther and Calvin, did not deny that
justification is wrought by faith, but they defined
justifying faith in a manner altogether foreign to
the mind of the Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) They distinguished three kinds of faith: (1) belief
in the existence of God and the historical fact that
Christ has come on earth, suffered, and ascended (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
historica</span></span>); (2) the sort of trust which is required for
exercising the gift of miracles (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
miraculorum</span></span>); and
(3) faith in the divine promises with regard to the remission
of sin (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides promissionum</span></span>).
The last-mentioned species of faith they subdivided into general and
particular. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Fides generalis</span></span>
is that by which we believe
that the righteousness of Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“covers”</span> (but does not
wipe out) our sins. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Fides
specialis</span></span> or fiduciary faith
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fiducia</span></span>)
is that by which a man applies to himself the
righteousness of the Redeemer, firmly trusting that his
sins are for Christ's sake not imputed to him. Thus the
Reformers erroneously transferred the seat of justifying
faith from the intellect to the will and completely
subverted the Catholic notion of faith as an intellectual
assent to revealed truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) To this fundamental error the Fathers of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Trent opposed the orthodox doctrine that
(adults) <span class="tei tei-q">“are disposed unto justice when, excited
and assisted by divine grace, receiving faith by
hearing, they are freely moved towards God, believing
those things to be true which God has revealed
and promised, ...”</span><a id="noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> and they solemnly
anathematized those who assert <span class="tei tei-q">“that justifying
faith is nothing else but confidence in the divine
mercy which remits sin for Christ's sake, or that
this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified.”</span><a id="noteref_783" name="noteref_783" href="#note_783"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence it is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de fide</span></span> that the faith whereby man
is justified, is not a confident persuasion of being
esteemed righteous in the sight of God, but a
dogmatic or theoretical belief in the truths of
Divine Revelation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Refutation of the Lutheran Doctrine
of Fiduciary Faith.</span></span>—Whenever Sacred Scripture
and Tradition speak of justifying faith, they
mean a dogmatic belief in the truths of Revelation,—that
faith which the Protestants call <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
historica</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Christ Himself solemnly commanded His
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Apostles and their successors to preach the Gospel
to all nations, and before baptizing them to convert
them to a firm belief in certain specified
truths which no man may reject except at the
peril of his eternal salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) Mark XVI, 15 sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye into the whole world,
and preach the gospel<a id="noteref_784" name="noteref_784" href="#note_784"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a>
to every creature: He that believeth
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> in the Gospel] and is baptized, shall be
saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned.”</span>
Agreeable to this injunction St. John declares it to be
the object of his Gospel <span class="tei tei-q">“that you may believe that<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href="#note_785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a>

written <span class="tei tei-q">“that we may believe.”</span> What must we believe?
That <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.”</span> This is a
revealed truth by firmly believing which we shall be
saved. When the treasurer of Queen Candace begged
to be baptized, Philip the deacon said to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou
believest with all thy heart, thou mayest.”</span> The eunuch
replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,”</span>
whereupon Philip baptized him.<a id="noteref_787" name="noteref_787" href="#note_787"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) St. Paul in his Epistles to the Romans and
the Galatians eloquently insists on the necessity of
faith, not a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
fiducialis</span></span>, but a believing acceptance
of Divine Revelation. Cfr. Rom. X, 9
sq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“For if thou confess with thy mouth the
Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God hath
raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart we believe unto justice, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</span><a id="noteref_788" name="noteref_788" href="#note_788"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a>
We must confess with the mouth and believe
with the heart. External profession and internal
faith go together and have for their common
object a certain truth open to our knowledge,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: the resurrection of Christ,—a dogma in
which the whole teaching of the atonement lies
imbedded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The character of justifying faith is still more
plainly evident from Heb. XI, 6: <span class="tei tei-q">“Without faith
it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh
to God [he that is to be justified], must believe
that He is [the existence of God], and is a rewarder
to them that seek Him.”</span><a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> The Apostle
here clearly asserts both the necessity of justifying
faith and the minimum of doctrine to be explicitly
<span class="tei tei-q">“believed,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: the existence of God and eternal
retribution.<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href="#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
γ) The Lutherans appeal chiefly to Matth. IX, 2, Luke
XVII, 19, Rom. IV, 5, and Heb. XI, 1. But not a
single one of these texts represents fiduciary faith as
the instrumental cause of justification. The word πίστις
occurs no less than eighty times in the Synoptic Gospels
and in St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, but there are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only six passages in which it could possibly be construed
as synonymous with <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fiducia</span></span>,
and in none of these is the
interpretation entirely certain. Not once does the New
Testament employ πίστις in the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“fiduciary
faith,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> a confident
persuasion of one's own righteousness.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Tradition is in such perfect agreement with
Scripture on this point that the Reformers did not
venture to deny that their doctrine ran counter to
the time-honored teaching of the Church. The
Fathers unanimously insist on the necessity of
dogmatic faith as a requisite of justification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) St. Fulgentius of Ruspe, who is regarded as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
best theologian of his time”</span> (468-533),<a id="noteref_792" name="noteref_792" href="#note_792"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">792</span></span></a> in his golden
booklet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Fide seu de Regula Verae Fidei ad Petrum</span></span>,
says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I rejoice that you take care to preserve the
true faith without which conversion is useless, nay, impossible.
Apostolic authority tells us that we cannot
please God without faith. For faith is the foundation
of all good [works]; it is the beginning of human salvation,
and without it no one can obtain a place among
the children of God, because without it no one can obtain
the grace of justification in this world or possess eternal life
in the next.”</span><a id="noteref_793" name="noteref_793" href="#note_793"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">793</span></span></a> St. Fulgentius was a faithful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
disciple of St. Augustine, and the whole trend of
his treatise shows that by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vera
fides</span></span> he understands not the Lutheran
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fiducia propriae iustificationis</span></span>, but
Catholic belief in revealed truth.<a id="noteref_794" name="noteref_794" href="#note_794"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) This teaching is corroborated by the ancient
practice of instructing the catechumens in the
truths of revelation and requiring them to make a
public profession of faith before Baptism. It was
because they believed and professed the true faith
that the early Christians, who knew nothing of
the Lutheran <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
fiducialis</span></span>, were called <span class="tei tei-q">“faithful”</span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fideles</span></span>,
πιστοί), to distinguish them from false
believers or heretics (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">haeretici</span></span>,
αἱρητικοὶ, from
αἱρεῖσθαι to choose), who denied some portion or
other of the orthodox creed.

c) In analyzing the notions of
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides</span></span> and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas</span></span>
theologians distinguish between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
explicita</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides implicita</span></span>,
and between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas
medii</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas praecepti</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Fides explicita</span></span>
is an express and fully developed belief in the truths of revelation;
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides implicita</span></span>, a virtual belief
in whatever may be contained in a dogma explicitly
professed. I make an act of implicit faith when I say,
for instance: <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe whatever the Church teaches,”</span>
or: <span class="tei tei-q">“I heartily accept whatever God has revealed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas medii</span></span>
is based on the objective relation
of means to an end, and consequently binds all men,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even the ignorant and those who are in error without
their own fault. Such, for example, is the necessity of
the eye for seeing, of wings for flying, of grace for performing
salutary acts, of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lumen gloriae</span></span> for the
beatific vision. The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas
praecepti</span></span>, on the other
hand, is founded entirely on the will of God, who positively
commands or forbids under pain of grievous sin,
but is willing to condone non-compliance with his precepts
when it is owing to guiltless ignorance. This applies
to all positive divine precepts, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the law of fasting
and abstinence. It is to be noted that the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas medii</span></span> always involves the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas praecepti</span></span>, because God
must needs will and impose upon us by positive precept
whatever is objectively necessary as a means of salvation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The first question that arises with regard to
this twofold faith and necessity is: Are sinners
preparing for justification, and the faithful in general,
obliged by necessity of precept to believe explicitly
all revealed truths? The answer is, No;
because this is practically impossible, and God
does not demand the impossible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Generally speaking, it is sufficient to have an explicit
knowledge of, and give one's firm assent to, the more
important dogmas and moral precepts—the twelve articles
of the Apostles' Creed, the Commandments of God
and the Church, the Sacraments (as needed), and the Our
Father. All other revealed truths need be held only <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fide
implicitâ</span></span>.<a id="noteref_795" name="noteref_795" href="#note_795"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">795</span></span></a>
More is of course demanded of educated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
persons and those who are in duty bound to instruct
others, such as priests and teachers.<a id="noteref_796" name="noteref_796" href="#note_796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">796</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) A more important and more difficult question
is this: Are there any dogmas, and if so
how many, which must be believed by all men <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fide
explicitâ</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate
medii</span></span>? St. Paul says:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Without faith it is impossible to please God, for
he that cometh to God, must believe that He is,
and is a rewarder to them that seek Him.”</span><a id="noteref_797" name="noteref_797" href="#note_797"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With but few exceptions,<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href="#note_798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">798</span></span></a> Catholic theologians maintain
that the Apostle in this passage means theological
faith, based upon supernatural motives. This interpretation
is borne out by the context, by such parallel texts
as John III, 11 sqq., 32 sqq., 2 Tim. I, 12, 1 John V, 9 sq.,
and by the decisions of several councils.<a id="noteref_799" name="noteref_799" href="#note_799"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">799</span></span></a> There
can be no reasonable doubt that all men, to be justified and
saved, must have an explicit belief in at least two dogmas,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: the existence of God and eternal retribution. Pope
Innocent XI condemned the Jansenist proposition that explicit
belief in divine retribution is not necessary for
salvation.<a id="noteref_800" name="noteref_800" href="#note_800"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">800</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Are there any other dogmas which must be explicitly
believed <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate
medii</span></span>? The only dogmas which
might come in question are: the Trinity, the Incarnation,
the immortality of the soul, and the necessity of grace.
The last-mentioned two may be omitted from the list, because
St. Paul does not mention them,<a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a> and for the additional
reason that belief in immortality is included in the
dogma of eternal retribution, while the necessity of grace
is inseparably bound up with the dogma of Divine Providence,
which in its turn is but a particular aspect of
eternal retribution.<a id="noteref_802" name="noteref_802" href="#note_802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">802</span></span></a> Hence the only two dogmas in regard
to which the question at the beginning of this paragraph
can reasonably be asked, are the Blessed Trinity
and the Incarnation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theologians are divided in the matter. Some maintain
that no human being can or could ever be saved
without explicit belief in both the Trinity and the Incarnation.
Others<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a>
hold that this <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas medii</span></span> did not
exist under the Old Covenant. A third school<a id="noteref_804" name="noteref_804" href="#note_804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a> avers
that no such necessity can be proved either for the Old or
the New Dispensation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first of these three opinions is excessively rigorous
and intrinsically improbable. The Jews had no clearly revealed
knowledge of the Trinity and the Incarnation, and
consequently were under no obligation to believe them.
As the divinely constituted guardians of the Messianic
prophecies, they were bound to believe in the Redeemer,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
though only <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitate
praecepti</span></span>. The gentiles were dispensed
even from this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second opinion, which limits the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas medii</span></span>
to the New Testament, lacks solid proof. The Scripture
texts cited in its support merely prove the efficaciousness
of belief in Christ,<a id="noteref_805" name="noteref_805" href="#note_805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a> or the duty of embracing
that belief on the strength of the Apostolic preaching,<a id="noteref_806" name="noteref_806" href="#note_806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">806</span></span></a>
or, finally, the impossibility of redemption except
through the mediation of Jesus;<a id="noteref_807" name="noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a>—all truths which in
themselves have nothing to do with the question under
discussion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third and most probable opinion is that even under
the New Covenant, explicit faith in Christ, and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
fortiori</span></span> in the Divine Trinity, cannot be regarded as an
indispensable medium of justification and salvation, (1)
because St. Paul does not mention these two dogmas in
the decisive passage, Heb. XI, 6; and (2) because a
supernatural act of justifying love and contrition may be
inspired by belief in the existence of God and divine
retribution; and (3) because this latter belief implicitly,

to believe in the Trinity and the Incarnation by more
than a mere <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessitas

1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Heretical Errors and the Teaching of
the Church.</span></span>—Martin Luther, to quiet his conscience,
evolved the notion that faith alone justifies
and that the Catholic doctrine of the necessity
of good works is pharisaical and derogatory to
the merits of Jesus Christ. This teaching was
incorporated into the symbolic books of the Lutherans<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811" href="#note_811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a>

called one of the two basic errors of Protestantism.
The Tridentine Council solemnly
condemns it as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“If anyone saith that by
faith alone the impious is justified, in such wise as
to mean that nothing else is required to coöperate
in order to obtain the grace of justification, and
that it is not in any way necessary that he be prepared
and disposed by the movement of his own

dispose or prepare the soul for justification, according
to the same Council, are: the fear of
divine justice; hope in God's mercy; charity,
which is the font of all righteousness; detestation
of sin, and penitence.<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href="#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a>

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Refutation of the Sola Fides Theory.</span></span>—The
Lutheran theory involves an open rupture
with the traditional teaching of the Church and
is positively unscriptural. Luther himself felt
this, as appears from his interpolation of the word
<span class="tei tei-q">“alone”</span> in Rom. III, 28 and his rejection of the
entire canonical Epistle of St. James.<a id="noteref_815" name="noteref_815" href="#note_815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The teaching of the Bible in regard to the
rôle played by good works in the process of justification
may be summarized as follows:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) A man may believe all that the Church
teaches and yet be lost for want of good works
or because he has not the love of God; consequently,
faith alone does not justify or insure
eternal salvation. Our Divine Saviour Himself
declares: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not every one that saith to me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but
he that doeth the will of my Father who is in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven.”</span><a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a> St. James says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not see
that by works a man is justified, and not by faith
only?”</span><a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> And St. Paul: <span class="tei tei-q">“If I should have all
faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have
not charity, I am nothing.”</span><a id="noteref_818" name="noteref_818" href="#note_818"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) Besides faith, justification requires certain
other preparatory or dispositive acts. There is,
for example, the fear of divine justice. Cfr.
Ecclus. I, 28: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that is without fear cannot
be justified.”</span><a id="noteref_819" name="noteref_819" href="#note_819"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">819</span></span></a> Also, hope in God's mercy. Cfr.
Rom. VIII, 24: <span class="tei tei-q">“For we are saved by hope.”</span><a id="noteref_820" name="noteref_820" href="#note_820"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a>
Again, charity. Cfr. Luke VII, 47: <span class="tei tei-q">“Many
sins are forgiven her because she hath loved
much.”</span><a id="noteref_821" name="noteref_821" href="#note_821"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">821</span></span></a> Furthermore, contrition or penitence.
Cfr. Luke XIII, 3: <span class="tei tei-q">“Unless you shall do penance,
you shall all likewise perish.”</span><a id="noteref_822" name="noteref_822" href="#note_822"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> Finally,
good works in general. Cfr. St. James II, 17:
<span class="tei tei-q">“So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in
itself.”</span><a id="noteref_823" name="noteref_823" href="#note_823"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a>
No one who ponders these and similar
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
texts can maintain, as Calvin and Melanchthon
did, that the good works mentioned merely accompany
justification, for they are unmistakably
described as causes which dispose and prepare the
sinner for it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) It is not faith alone that justifies, but faith
informed and actuated by charity. Cfr. Gal. V, 6:
<span class="tei tei-q">“For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth
anything, nor uncircumcision: but faith that
worketh by charity.”</span><a id="noteref_824" name="noteref_824" href="#note_824"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">824</span></span></a> The Greek text shows
that the word <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operatur</span></span> in the Vulgate must be
taken passively, so that a more correct translation
would be: <span class="tei tei-q">“... but faith effected or formed by
charity.”</span> But even if ἐνεργουμένη were used as a deponent
(ἐνεργεῖσθαι=<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">agere</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operari</span></span>) the meaning
would be substantially the same, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> a dead faith,
without charity, avails nothing. Cfr. St. James
II, 26: <span class="tei tei-q">“For even as the body without the spirit
is dead, so also faith without works is dead.”</span><a id="noteref_825" name="noteref_825" href="#note_825"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">825</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Rom. III, 28: <span class="tei tei-q">“For we account a man to be justified
by faith, without the works of the law,”</span><a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> Luther
deliberately inserted the word <span class="tei tei-q">“alone.”</span> The context
shows that this is a falsification. The Apostle contrasts
justifying faith, not with those preparatory acts of salvation
which spring from it, but with the sterile <span class="tei tei-q">“works of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the law”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the Old Testament), which, as such,
possessed no more power to justify than the good works
of the heathen. Keeping this contrast in mind, it
would not be incorrect to say, and St. Paul might well
have said, that <span class="tei tei-q">“supernatural faith alone (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> only) justifies,
while the works of the law do not.”</span> But if faith
be taken in contradistinction to the other acts operative in
the process of justification, such as fear, hope, contrition,
love,—and this is the sense in which Luther takes it,—then
it is false and contrary to the mind of St. Paul to
say: <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith alone justifies, nothing else is required.”</span>
For in this sense faith is merely the beginning, the
foundation, the root of justification and cannot justify the
sinner until it has absorbed the other preparatory acts required
by Holy Scripture and transformed them into perfect
love. This fact was already pointed out by St. Augustine.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unintelligent persons,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“with regard
to the Apostle's statement: <span class="tei tei-q">‘We conclude that a man is
justified by faith without the works of the law,’</span> have
thought him to mean that faith is sufficient for a man,
even if he leads a bad life and has no good deeds to allege.
It is impossible that such a character should be
deemed <span class="tei tei-q">‘a vessel of election’</span> by the Apostle, who, after
declaring that <span class="tei tei-q">‘in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth
anything nor uncircumcision,’</span> adds the important
remark: <span class="tei tei-q">‘but faith that worketh by charity.’</span> It is such
faith which separates the faithful children of God from
unclean devils,—for even these <span class="tei tei-q">‘believe and tremble,’</span> as
the Apostle James says, but they do no good works.
Therefore they possess not the faith by which the just
man lives,—the faith which operates through love in
such wise that God recompenses it according to its works
with eternal life.”</span><a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is another sense in which faith alone may be
said to justify, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: if the term be taken to include all
those things which God has ordained for our salvation,
that is to say, the sum-total of <span class="tei tei-q">“revelation”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“the
true religion”</span> as opposed to <span class="tei tei-q">“heresy.”</span> The term πίστις
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides</span></span>)
is sometimes employed in this sense by the Fathers,
but never in Sacred Scripture.<a id="noteref_828" name="noteref_828" href="#note_828"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) There is a unanimous and unbroken tradition
in favor of the Catholic doctrine. St. Polycarp
writes in his Epistle to the Philippians:
<span class="tei tei-q">“... the faith (πίστις) given you, which is
the mother of us all when hope (ἐλπίς) follows
and love (ἀγάπη) goes before.”</span><a id="noteref_829" name="noteref_829" href="#note_829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a> St. Augustine
teaches that while faith is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span> separable
from hope and love, it is ineffective without them.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Man begins with faith, but the demons, too, believe
and tremble; to faith, therefore, must be
added hope, and to hope, love.”</span><a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830" href="#note_830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a> And again:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Without love, faith can indeed exist, but it availeth
nothing.”</span><a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> St. Gregory the Great, paraphrasing
St. James, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Perhaps some one will
say to himself: I have believed, I shall be saved.
He speaks truly if he sustains faith by works.
For that is true faith which does not contradict by
deeds what it asserts in words.”</span><a id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832" href="#note_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) This teaching is in perfect conformity with
reason.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) No supernatural enlightenment is needed
to perceive the intrinsic propriety of a moral preparation
for justification. Not only must the sinner
learn to know God as His supernatural end
and the source of all righteousness, but he must
also be persuaded that it is his duty, with the help
of sufficient grace, to direct his will towards this
final end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every tendency or movement presupposes a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terminus
a quo</span></span>, from which it starts, and a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terminus ad quem</span></span>,
to which it tends. The movement of the will in the
process of justification, besides faith, demands a voluntary
withdrawal from sin (contrition, good resolutions)
and an approach to righteousness (hope, love, desire).<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href="#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This argument would have made no impression on
Luther, since he bluntly denied free-will in the moral order
and regarded human nature as so radically depraved
by original sin as to be incapable of coöperating with divine
grace. In fact he compared man to a <span class="tei tei-q">“log, stick
or stone.”</span> This view was shared by Amsdorf, Flacius,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and others, whereas Osiander and Butzer admitted that
<span class="tei tei-q">“inherent righteousness”</span> is at least a partial factor in justification.
Melanchthon, in an endeavor to reconcile the
contradictions of this discordant system, unwittingly gave rise to the so-called
Synergist dispute. When Pfeffinger<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href="#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a>
undertook the defence of free-will, many Lutheran
theologians, especially of the University of Jena, boldly attacked
the log-stick-and-stone theory<a id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835" href="#note_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> and
tried to force their adversaries to admit that man is able
to coöperate with grace. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Half-Melanchthonians,”</span>
as they were called, succeeded in smuggling Synergism
into the <span class="tei tei-q">“Book of Torgau;”</span><a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href="#note_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a> but before the <span class="tei tei-q">“Formulary
of Concord”</span> was finally printed in the monastery
of Bergen, near Magdeburg (A. D. 1577), the strict
Lutherans had eliminated that article as heterodox and
substituted for it the log-stick-and-stone theory as it
appears in the official symbols of the Lutheran Church.
In the Syncretist dispute, and through the efforts of
the Pietists, this harsh teaching was afterwards moderated.
But what probably contributed most to the
crumbling of the system was the rapid growth of Socinianism
and Rationalism among the Lutherans in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. To-day, with the
exception of a small band of <span class="tei tei-q">“orthodox”</span> Lutherans in
Saxony and the United States, Protestants no longer hold
the log-stick-and-stone theory. The school of Luther proclaimed
it as the distinguishing tenet of Protestantism, as <span class="tei tei-q">“the criterion of a standing
or falling church,”</span><a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a>—and
by this criterion the Lutheran Church has indeed fallen.
Common sense has led modern Protestants to admit that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contrition and penance are quite as necessary for justification as faith, an
opinion which, in the words of Dorner,<a id="noteref_838" name="noteref_838" href="#note_838"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">838</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“comes dangerously near the Catholic system.”</span> In
Scandinavia, according to Dr. Krogh-Tonning,<a id="noteref_839" name="noteref_839" href="#note_839"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">839</span></span></a> the Lutheran
Church has experienced a <span class="tei tei-q">“quiet reformation”</span> and
now unconsciously defends the Catholic doctrine of justification.<a id="noteref_840" name="noteref_840" href="#note_840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">840</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) As the sufficiency of the Bible without
Tradition is the formal principle of <span class="tei tei-q">“orthodox”</span>
Protestantism, so justification by faith alone may
be said to be its material principle. The absurdity
of the Lutheran position is evident from
the fact that these two principles are mutually
destructive. So far from teaching justification
by faith alone, the Bible inculcates the exact contrary,
while its sufficiency as the source of faith
could be proved from its own pages, if at all, only
by a vicious circle.<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841" href="#note_841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a> Thus the whole Protestant
system is based on contradiction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sola fides</span></span>
theory is open to serious objection also
from the ethical point of view. It cannot be put into
practice without grave danger. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sin lustily,”</span> writes Luther, <span class="tei tei-q">“but be yet
more lusty in faith.”</span><a id="noteref_842" name="noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a> The first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
part at least of this injunction was promptly obeyed by
his followers, and the rapid deterioration of morals which
followed was but a natural sequel of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sola fides</span></span> theory.
If faith alone were sufficient for justification, it would
make no difference what kind of life a man led, for
unbelief, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the loss of fiduciary faith, would be the
only sin. No wonder this ethical antinomism of the
Lutheran system, so radically opposed to the teaching of
St. James, was rejected by Hugo Grotius, George Buller,
and other honest Protestants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another weighty objection against the Lutheran theory
of justification is that it disregards the law of causation.
According to Luther a man is justified by the firm belief
and trust that his sins are forgiven. This <span class="tei tei-q">“belief”</span>
is either true or false. If it is false, I can have no
certainty with regard to my salvation, but am deceiving
myself. If true, it presupposes that which it is to effect,
in other words, it puts the cause before the effect.
An orthodox Lutheran theologian of the old school would
probably retort: My sins are actually forgiven by virtue of
the atonement, because all men without exception are redeemed
through the merits of Jesus Christ. If this be
true, then why not be consistent and say: All men are
justified because all are redeemed, consequently there is
no need of faith and sacraments, and keeping the
commandments is a matter of indifference! It is at this
point that the incompatibility of Luther's teaching with
the Bible and sound ethics becomes most glaringly apparent.
True, Luther himself at times emphasized the necessity
of good works; but this merely proves that he had
lucid intervals when his honest nature rebelled against the
inconsistency of his teaching.<a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843" href="#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a>

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Explanation of the Catholic Doctrine.</span></span>—The
Council of Trent assigned to faith its
proper place in the process of justification,<a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href="#note_844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a> and
gave a luminous and profound analysis of the
process itself.<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href="#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a>
Scholastic theology, in elaborating
the teaching of Scripture and Tradition, drew
a distinction between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
formata</span></span>, which truly justifies, and
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides informis</span></span>, which falls short of
justification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) As regards the intrinsic relation of (dogmatic)
faith to other preparatory acts in the process of justification,
the Tridentine Council declares: <span class="tei tei-q">“Faith is the
beginning of human salvation, the foundation and the
root of all justification.”</span><a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> Supernatural faith, therefore,
is the beginning of salvation, and not, as Harnack makes
Luther say, <span class="tei tei-q">“at once the beginning, the middle, and the
end,”</span> because no man can be converted unless he has
believingly embraced God as his final goal. This faith is
preceded by certain preliminary conditions, of which the
first is an illumination of the intellect and a strengthening
of the will, which results in the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">affectus credulitatis</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">initia fidei</span></span>).
For justifying faith does not flash forth
suddenly, like a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">deus
ex machina</span></span>, but requires time for its development, as the history
of many conversions proves.<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Faith is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“foundation”</span> of justification because
it not only marks its beginning, but constitutes the
basis upon which all subsequent stages of the process rest.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
To exclude the mistaken notion that the process of
justification is a series of mechanical and disconnected
acts, the Council calls faith the <span class="tei tei-q">“root”</span> of justification,
from which the other preparatory acts spring organically,
as the trunk of a tree from its root.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The psychological description of the whole process
given by the Tridentine Fathers, which even Harnack admits
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a masterly piece of work,”</span> runs as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now they [adults] are disposed unto justice when, excited
and assisted by divine grace, conceiving faith by
hearing, they are freely moved towards God, believing
those things to be true which God has revealed and
promised,—and this especially, that God justifies the impious
by His grace through the redemption that is in
Jesus Christ; and when, understanding themselves to be
sinners, they, by turning themselves from the fear of
divine justice, whereby they are profitably agitated, to
consider the mercy of God, are raised unto hope, confiding
that God will be propitious to them for Christ's
sake; and they begin to love Him as the fountain of all
justice, and are therefore moved against sins by a certain
hatred and detestation, to wit: by that penitence
which must be performed before Baptism; lastly, when
they purpose to receive Baptism, to begin a new life, and
to keep the commandments of God....”</span><a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href="#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a> The four
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ordinary stages in the process of justification, therefore,
are: (1) From faith to fear of divine justice; (2) from fear to hope; (3) from
hope to initial love;<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href="#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> (4) from
initial love to contrition and a firm purpose of
amendment.<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href="#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> If contrition is dictated and transfused
by perfect love,<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a> and the sinner has an explicit or at least implicit
desire for the Sacrament,<a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href="#note_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a> justification takes
place at once. If, on the other hand, the sinner's sorrow
is imperfect (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">attritio</span></span>),
he attains justification only by
actual reception of the Sacrament (Baptism or Penance).<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href="#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Does conversion always follow this conciliary
schema? No. The Council did not mean to define that
these acts must follow one another in strict sequence or
that they are one and all absolutely indispensable for justification.
It is certain, however, that the process invariably
begins with faith and ends with contrition accompanied
by a firm purpose of amendment. In exceptional
cases (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the Prodigal Son, Mary Magdalen) perfect
charity seems immediately to follow faith, and
may then be said virtually to include the intermediate
stages of fear, hope, and contrition. Yet this is not the
usual way. Ordinarily faith elicits fear, which in turn
produces two kinds of hope—hope of forgiveness
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">spes veniae</span></span>)
and hope in God (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">spes theologica</span></span>), which marks
the beginning of charity (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amor
concupiscentiae</span></span>). Contrition is always a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">conditio sine qua non</span></span>, because there
can be no forgiveness of sin without sorrow for it.<a id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854" href="#note_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a> It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is for this reason that, according to St. Thomas, explicit
contrition for mortal sins is necessary for justification
even when there is perfect charity, and the sufficiency of
the so-called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">poenitentia
virtualis</span></span> is limited to venial offenses
and such grievous sins as cannot be remembered.<a id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855" href="#note_855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a>
Fear, while not absolutely indispensable, is seldom absent.
Holy Scripture tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“the fear of God is the beginning
of wisdom,”</span> and it is natural for the sinner seeking
forgiveness to detest his sins out of fear of divine
justice before he attains to the motive of perfect charity.<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Certain utterances of Scripture and the Fathers with regard to the possibility
of a <span class="tei tei-q">“dead”</span> faith<a id="noteref_857" name="noteref_857" href="#note_857"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a> have led
theologians to distinguish between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
informis</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
formata</span></span>. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Fides informis</span></span>
is a dead faith, devoid of charity,
and without justifying power. The only faith that
can justify a man is that which is animated by charity and
productive of good works.<a id="noteref_858" name="noteref_858" href="#note_858"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a>
This is the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides formata</span></span> of
the Schoolmen, which includes all the preparatory acts
enumerated by the Tridentine Council, from fear to perfect
charity. These acts, however, though united in the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides formata</span></span>,
retain their respective independence, and
can disappear singly, one after another, as they came.
Zwingli's assertion that faith, hope, and charity are identical,
or at least inseparable, has been expressly condemned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the Tridentine Council: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one saith that,
grace being lost through sin, faith also is always lost with
it; or that the faith which remains, though it be no live
faith, is not a true faith; or that he who has faith without charity is not a
Christian; let him be anathema.”</span><a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href="#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though the term <span class="tei tei-q">“justification”</span> may be extended to
the preparatory acts that lead up to the state of justice,
strictly speaking it signifies only that decisive moment in
which the sinner is cleansed from mortal sin by an infusion
of sanctifying grace. Hence a careful distinction
must be made between justification as an act
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">actus iustificationis</span></span>)
and justification as an habitual state (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus
iustificationis s. status gratiae sanctificantis</span></span>). The transient
act introduces a permanent state, just as the Sacrament
of Holy Orders constitutes a man in the sacerdotal
state or priesthood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Both as an act and as a state justification possesses
three distinct properties; it is uncertain, unequal, and
capable of being lost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This gives us the basis for a division of the
present Chapter into three Sections: (1) On
the Nature of Justification, (2) On Justifying, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
Sanctifying Grace, and (3) On the Properties of
that Grace.

Justification in the active sense
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">iustificatio</span></span>,
δικαίωσις) is defined by the Tridentine Council as
<span class="tei tei-q">“a translation from that state wherein man is born
a child of the first Adam, to the state of grace and

Adam, Jesus Christ, our Saviour.”</span><a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href="#note_860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a>

Justification, therefore, has both a negative and a
positive element. The positive element is interior sanctification
through the merits of Jesus Christ. The negative
element consists in the forgiveness of sin. Though
these elements are objectively inseparable, the forgiveness
of sin being practically an effect of interior sanctification,
yet we must treat them separately in order to be
able to refute more effectively the Lutheran heresy that
sin is not wiped out but merely <span class="tei tei-q">“covered,”</span> and that justification
consists in an external <span class="tei tei-q">“imputation”</span> of the righteousness
of Christ.

It requires no special acuteness to perceive that
this Biblical teaching is irreconcilably opposed to
the Protestant theory of non-imputation. If, as
the Lutherans allege, God merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">declared</span></em> the believer
just, justification would not blot out or
take away sin, nor could it be truthfully said
that light and life take the place of death and
darkness; something deserving of condemnation
would still remain in those that are in Christ
Jesus.<a id="noteref_890" name="noteref_890" href="#note_890"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a>

There are a few Scriptural texts that seem to favor
the Lutheran view, but they must be interpreted in conformity
with the general teaching of the Bible as outlined
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
above. Among these texts is Ps. XXXI, 1 sq.:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and
whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom
the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there
is no guile.”</span><a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href="#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a>
The parallelism apparent in this verse
allows us to conclude that <span class="tei tei-q">“covered”</span> is used in the
sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“remitted”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“he to whom the Lord
hath not imputed sin”</span> is identical with the man <span class="tei tei-q">“in
whose spirit there is no guile.”</span> The text manifestly
refers to a real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forgiveness</span></em> of sins, for any sin that God
<span class="tei tei-q">“covers”</span> and ceases to <span class="tei tei-q">“impute,”</span> must be blotted out
and swept away, because <span class="tei tei-q">“all things are naked and open
to the eyes”</span> of the omniscient Creator.<a id="noteref_892" name="noteref_892" href="#note_892"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">892</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) The theological argument may be briefly formulated
as follows: We can imagine but two reasons why
God should not truly forgive us our sins in the process
of justification: inability and unwillingness. To say that
He is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unable</span></em> to forgive us our sins would be to assert
that the remission of sin involves a metaphysical impossibility.
This no Protestant will admit, because all
believe that <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing defiled shall enter into heaven.”</span><a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href="#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a>
To assert that God is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unwilling</span></em> to forgive our sins would
be to contradict the plain teaching of Scripture, as set
forth above. Consequently there is no reason whatever
for assuming that God does not truly forgive us our sins
in the process of justification. Furthermore, it would
be incompatible with His veracity and holiness to assume
that He merely declares the sinner to be <span class="tei tei-q">“free from sin,”</span>
without actually cleansing his soul. It would be a contradiction
to assert that a man whom the truthful and all-holy
God has declared free from sin, remains steeped in
iniquity. Cfr. Prov. XVII, 15: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that justifieth the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wicked [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> absolves him from his sins], and he that condemneth
the just, both are abominable before God.”</span>

According to Revelation the justification of the sinner
is not a mere change, with a privation for its

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">terminus ad quem</span></span>,
but involves a movement from extreme to extreme, and
hence the genesis of the one extreme must coincide with

1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Heretical Errors and the Church.</span></span>—Calvin

also be a positive element in the process, but
differed in determining its nature.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The ambiguous language employed by Luther and
Melanchthon gave rise to many different opinions,
which agreed only in one point, that is, in holding,
contrary to Catholic teaching, that the positive element
of justification is not inward sanctification or inherent
righteousness (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> sanctifying grace). Probably
the view most common among the supporters of
the Augsburg Confession was that the sinner, by a
<span class="tei tei-q">“fiduciary apprehension”</span> of God's mercy, as proclaimed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the Gospel, <span class="tei tei-q">“apprehends”</span> the extrinsic justice of
Christ, and with it covers his sins, which are thereupon
no longer <span class="tei tei-q">“imputed”</span> to him. In other words,
he is outwardly accounted and declared righteous in
the sight of God, though inwardly he remains a sinner.
With the exception of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sola

shibboleth in the sixteenth century so persistently

as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">iustitia Christi
extra nos</span></span>.”</span> It is found in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apologia</span></span> written in defence of the Augsburg
Confession<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href="#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a>

the <span class="tei tei-q">“orthodox”</span> Lutheran view, therefore, justification
on its positive side is a purely forensic and outward

to hide the wounds of his soul.<a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907" href="#note_907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a>

In thus defining the doctrine of the Church, the Council
did not, however, mean to deny that the sinner is

grace of justification. He merely wished to emphasize the
fact that a sinner is not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">formaliter</span></span>
justified by the imputation of Christ's justice. For the sake of greater clearness
the various <span class="tei tei-q">“causes”</span> of justification are enumerated
as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Of this justification the causes are these:
the final cause indeed is the glory of God and of Jesus

but the meritorious cause is His most beloved only-begotten
Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who ... merited
justification for us by His most holy Passion on the
wood of the Cross; ... the instrumental cause is the
Sacrament of Baptism, which is the sacrament of faith,
without which no man was ever justified; lastly, the
sole formal cause is the justice of God, not that whereby
He Himself is just, but that whereby He maketh us
just, that, to wit, with which we being endowed are renewed

justification appear to the Fathers of Trent, that they made it the subject
of a separate canon, to wit: <span class="tei tei-q">“If anyone saith that men

Justification in the Catholic sense, therefore, is
not a mere outward imputation of the justice of Christ,
but a true inward renewal and sanctification wrought by
a grace intrinsically inhering in the soul. This grace
theologians call the <span class="tei tei-q">“grace of justification.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The Lutheran theory of imputation can be most
effectively refuted by an analysis of the Scriptural
term <span class="tei tei-q">“regeneration”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">regeneratio</span></span>,
ἀναγέννησις, παλιγγενεσία).
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unless a man be born again of water and
the Holy Ghost,”</span> says our Divine Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.”</span><a id="noteref_918" name="noteref_918" href="#note_918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">918</span></span></a> This spiritual rebirth
wipes out sin and inwardly sanctifies the soul. The regenerate
sinner receives a new and godlike nature. That
this nature can be conceived in no other way than as a
state of sanctity and justice appears clearly from Tit. III,
5 sqq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“Not by the works of justice which we have done,
but according to His mercy, He saved us, by the laver of
regeneration and renovation of the Holy Ghost, whom he
hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus
Christ our Saviour: that, being justified by His grace, we
may be heirs, according to the hope of life everlasting.”</span><a id="noteref_919" name="noteref_919" href="#note_919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a>
Both text and context show that the Apostle is here speaking
of the justification of adult sinners in Baptism, which
he describes as a <span class="tei tei-q">“laver of regeneration and renovation”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
resulting in an <span class="tei tei-q">“outpouring of the Holy Ghost.”</span> These
phrases plainly denote a positive quality of the soul as well
as a permanent interior grace. Regeneration consists in
the remission of sin through Baptism, and also, more
particularly, in man being made like God, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> becoming
a child of God,<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a> while <span class="tei tei-q">“renovation”</span> means <span class="tei tei-q">“putting
off the old man”</span><a id="noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href="#note_921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“putting on the new.”</span><a id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922" href="#note_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a>
The <span class="tei tei-q">“outpouring of the Holy Ghost”</span> effected by Baptism
is not, of course, an outpouring of the Hypostasis
of the Third Person of the Trinity, but of created
grace, which re-forms the sinner and makes him
just.<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href="#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a> This justifying grace must not be conceived as
an actual grace, much less as a series of actual graces, for
it is not given us merely as an aid in the performance
of some particular act, but as a new nature. Regeneration
and renovation denote a state of being, as we can
plainly see in the case of baptized infants. It is for this
reason that the Apostle speaks of it as a lasting state;—that
which theologians call the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">status gratiae
sanctificantis</span></span>.<a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href="#note_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Closely akin to the notion of <span class="tei tei-q">“regeneration”</span> is that
of <span class="tei tei-q">“re-creation.”</span> Justification renews the sinner inwardly
and makes of him, so to speak, a new creature, which
has sloughed off sin and become just and holy in the
sight of God. Cfr. 2 Cor. V, 17: <span class="tei tei-q">“If then any be in
Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away,
behold all things are made new.”</span><a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="#note_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a> This is all the more
true since re-creation effects an <span class="tei tei-q">“incorporation of man
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with Christ,”</span> and is closely connected with <span class="tei tei-q">“regeneration
of God.”</span> Cfr. James I, 18: <span class="tei tei-q">“For of his own will
hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might
be some beginning of his creature.”</span><a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926" href="#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> A comparison
with Gal. VI, 15 and Gal. V, 6 fully establishes it as a
Biblical truth that in the process of justification the sinner,
through faith informed by charity, is changed into a
new creature. <span class="tei tei-q">“For in Christ Jesus,”</span> says St. Paul,
<span class="tei tei-q">“neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision,
but a new creature.”</span><a id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927" href="#note_927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> And again: <span class="tei tei-q">“In Christ
Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision,
but faith that worketh by charity.”</span><a id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928" href="#note_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> In both
these texts the Jewish rite of circumcision is rejected
as useless and contrasted with justification, which by
means of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides
formata</span></span> gives birth to a <span class="tei tei-q">“new creature.”</span>
This is incompatible with the Protestant notion
that a man is justified by being declared righteous in the
sight of God, though he remains inwardly unchanged.<a id="noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a>

β) The Lutherans vainly appeal to the fact that Holy Scripture employs the word

the purpose of declaring a man to be just in a
purely forensic sense, as in Is. V, 23: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who justify

against the Catholic doctrine, which is based entirely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The word <span class="tei tei-q">“justification”</span> also occurs in two other

for the <span class="tei tei-q">“law”</span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will keep thy justifications;”</span><a id="noteref_932" name="noteref_932" href="#note_932"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">932</span></span></a>

The Lutherans are equally unfortunate in maintaining
that St. Paul countenances their theory when he
speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“putting on Christ.”</span> Cfr. Gal. III, 27:

have put on Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_935" name="noteref_935" href="#note_935"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">935</span></span></a> The Apostle in employing this
simile does not mean to say that justification consists in
putting on an outward cloak of grace to cover sins which
inwardly endure, but precisely the contrary, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: that
the sinner by being justified is inwardly cleansed from
sin and becomes a new creature and a child of God. This
interpretation is supported by various parallel texts<a id="noteref_936" name="noteref_936" href="#note_936"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">936</span></span></a>

the same sense in which He is made unto us wisdom

The incongruity of the Lutheran doctrine of justification
becomes fully apparent from the consequences
which it involves, to wit: (1) all Christians without
distinction would possess exactly the same degree of
sanctity and justice; (2) justification once obtained by
fiduciary faith could not be lost except by the sin of
unbelief; and (3) children would not be justified by
Baptism because they are not sufficiently advanced in
the use of reason to enable them to <span class="tei tei-q">“apprehend”</span> the

a) It appears from the discussions preceding its sixth
session that the Tridentine Council not only meant
to condemn the heretical contention of Butzer that <span class="tei tei-q">“inherent
grace”</span> must be supplemented by the <span class="tei tei-q">“imputed justice of
Christ”</span> as the really essential factor of justification,<a id="noteref_957" name="noteref_957" href="#note_957"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">957</span></span></a>
but also wished to reject the view of divers contemporary
Catholic theologians<a id="noteref_958" name="noteref_958" href="#note_958"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">958</span></span></a> that <span class="tei tei-q">“intrinsic righteousness”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is inadequate to effect justification without a special

Council were on Scriptural ground. The principal effects
of justification,—forgiveness of sins and internal sanctification,—are
both produced by sanctifying grace. Sacred
Scripture is perfectly clear on this point. It represents
sin as opposed to grace in the same way in which
darkness is opposed to light,<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a> life to death,<a id="noteref_961" name="noteref_961" href="#note_961"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a>
the new man to the old.<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a>
The one necessarily excludes the other.
Sanctifying grace and sin cannot co-exist in the same
subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Internal sanctification may be defined as a permanent,
vital union with God, by which the soul becomes righteous
and holy in His sight and obtains a claim to Heaven.
That this is also a function of sanctifying grace appears
from those Scriptural texts which treat of the positive
element of justification.<a id="noteref_963" name="noteref_963" href="#note_963"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">963</span></span></a>
With this doctrine Tradition
is in perfect accord, and consequently the Fathers of
Trent were right in teaching as they did, in fact they
could not have taught otherwise.<a id="noteref_964" name="noteref_964" href="#note_964"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) While all Catholic theologians admit the incompatibility
of grace and sin in the same subject,
they differ as to the kind and degree of opposition
existing between the two. Some hold that
this opposition is purely moral, others that it is
physical, again others that it is metaphysical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) Nominalists<a id="noteref_965" name="noteref_965" href="#note_965"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">965</span></span></a> and Scotists<a id="noteref_966" name="noteref_966" href="#note_966"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">966</span></span></a> before the Tridentine
decision maintained that the distinction between
sanctifying grace and (original or mortal) sin is based on
a free decree of the Almighty, and therefore purely
moral. God, they held, by a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">favor
externus superadditus</span></span>,
externally supplies what sanctifying grace internally
lacks, just as a government's stamp raises the value
of a coin beyond the intrinsic worth of the bullion.
Followed to its legitimate conclusions, this shallow
theory means that sanctifying grace is of itself insufficient
to wipe out sin, and that, but for the superadded
divine favor, grace and sin might co-exist in the
soul. This is tantamount to saying that justification
requires a twofold formal cause, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: sanctifying grace
and a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">favor
Dei superadditus</span></span>,—which runs counter to
the teaching of Trent. Henno tries to escape this objection
by explaining that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">favor
Dei acceptans</span></span> appertains
not to the formal but merely to the efficient cause of
justification. But this contention is manifestly untenable.
Sanctifying grace is either able to wipe out sin, or
it is unable: if it is unable to produce this effect, the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">favor Dei acceptans</span></span>
must be part of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa formalis</span></span>
of justification, and then, in Henno's hypothesis, we
should have a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">duplex
causa formalis</span></span>, which contradicts
the Tridentine decree. If, on the other hand, sanctifying
grace is able to wipe out sin without any
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">favor superadditus</span></span>,
then the Scotistic theory has no <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) From what we have said it follows that there
must be at least a physical contrariety between grace and
sin. The difference between physical and metaphysical
opposition may be illustrated by the example of fire
and water. These two elements are incompatible by a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
law of nature. But as there is no metaphysical contradiction
between them, Almighty God could conceivably
bring them together. It is this physical kind of opposition
that Suarez and a few of his followers assume to
exist between grace and sin. Absolutely speaking, they
say, there is no intrinsic contradiction in the assumption
that God could preserve the physical entity of sanctifying
grace in a soul guilty of mortal sin.<a id="noteref_967" name="noteref_967" href="#note_967"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">967</span></span></a> In so far as
this school admits the existence of an internal opposition,
which actually prevents original or mortal sin from ever
co-existing in the soul with justifying grace, its teaching
may be said to be acceptable to all Catholic theologians.
The Scotistic view, on account of its incompatibility
with the teaching of the Tridentine Council, is no longer
held.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be questioned, however, whether Suarez goes
far enough in this matter, and whether the opposition
between grace and sin could really be overcome by a
miracle. The simultaneous co-existence of grace and sin
seems to involve an absolute, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> metaphysical, contradiction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
γ) This is what the Thomists maintain with the majority
of Jesuit theologians.<a id="noteref_968" name="noteref_968" href="#note_968"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">968</span></span></a> As some subtle objections
have been raised against this view, it cannot be accepted
as theologically certain; but it undoubtedly corresponds
better than its opposite to the spirit and letter of Scripture.
The Bible, as we have already pointed out,
likens the opposition existing between grace and sin to
that between life and death,<a id="noteref_969" name="noteref_969" href="#note_969"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">969</span></span></a> justice and injustice,

<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ergo</span></span>.<a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href="#note_971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">971</span></span></a> The same conclusion can be
reached by arguing from the character of sanctifying
grace as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">participatio
divinae naturae</span></span>.<a id="noteref_972" name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a>
If grace is a
participation in the divine nature, it must be opposed to
sin in the same way in which God Himself is opposed to
it. Now God as the All-Holy One is metaphysically opposed
to sin; consequently, the same kind of opposition
must exist between sanctifying grace and sin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is alleged against this teaching that between habitual
grace and habitual sin there is merely a disparate opposition,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> that of a physical to a moral form, the concepts
of which are not mutually exclusive. But sanctifying
grace is more than a physical ornament of the
soul; it is an ethical form which has for its essential
function to render the soul holy and righteous in the
sight of God.<a id="noteref_973" name="noteref_973" href="#note_973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">973</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sanctifying grace is defined by Deharbe as <span class="tei tei-q">“an
unmerited, supernatural gift, imparted to the soul
by the Holy Ghost, by which we are made just,
children of God, and heirs of Heaven.”</span> As it
makes sinners just, sanctifying grace is also called
justifying, though this appellation can not be
applied to the sanctification of our first parents
in Paradise or to that of the angels and the sinless
soul of Christ. Justification, as we have shown,
consists in the infusion of sanctifying grace, and
hence it is important that we obtain a correct idea
of the latter. We will therefore consider (1)
The Nature of Sanctifying Grace, (2) Its Effects
in the Soul, and (3) Its Supernatural Concomitants.

to obtain an idea of its true nature, to study its
effects, as made known to us by Revelation.
Sacred Scripture and the teaching of the Church
do, however, enable us to form certain well-defined
conclusions, of which the most important is
that sanctifying grace must be conceived as a permanent
quality (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas permanens</span></span>) of the soul.
If it is a permanent quality, sanctifying grace
cannot be identical with actual grace or with <span class="tei tei-q">“uncreated
grace,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the Person of the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) In conformity with such Biblical expressions as
<span class="tei tei-q">“the new life,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“renovation of the spirit,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“regeneration,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“divine sonship,”</span> etc., the Council of Trent defines
justifying grace as a supernatural something <span class="tei tei-q">“infused”</span>
into and <span class="tei tei-q">“inherent”</span> in the soul. Both ideas denote
a permanent state, not a mere transient act or the
result of such acts. <span class="tei tei-q">“The charity of God is poured forth

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before the Tridentine Council a number of theologians
held that sanctifying grace consists in some particular
actual grace or in a consecutive series of actual
graces. This view is incompatible with the definition just
quoted; in fact Suarez, Bellarmine, Ripalda, and others
regard it as positively heretical or at least intolerably
rash. During the preliminary debates at Trent some of
the Fathers asked for an express declaration of the Council
to the effect that justification is wrought by the instrumentality
of an infused habit; but their request was set
aside on the ground that the nature of justifying grace as
a stable habit is sufficiently indicated by the word
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inhaeret</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_978" name="noteref_978" href="#note_978"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">978</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That sanctifying grace is a permanent state of the soul
may also be inferred from the Catholic teaching that the
grace which Baptism imparts to children does not differ
essentially from that which it imparts to adults. True,
this teaching was not always regarded as certain;<a id="noteref_979" name="noteref_979" href="#note_979"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">979</span></span></a> but

at the Ecumenical Council of Vienne, A. D. 1311, Pope Clement V declared it
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“the more probable opinion,”</span><a id="noteref_980" name="noteref_980" href="#note_980"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">980</span></span></a>
and it was rendered absolutely certain by the Tridentine
decision that infant Baptism results not only in
the remission of sins, but likewise in an infusion of sanctifying
grace. This being so, there can be no essential
difference between the justification of children and that
of adults. Now it cannot be actual grace which renders
children righteous in the sight of God, for they are unable
to avail themselves of actual grace on account of the
undeveloped state of their intellect. The grace that Baptism
imparts to them is consequently a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia inhaerens

must be the same in adults.<a id="noteref_981" name="noteref_981" href="#note_981"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">981</span></span></a>

co-existing with the soul but something physically inherent
in it. Now, a thing which has its existence by inhering in
some other thing is in philosophic parlance an <span class="tei tei-q">“accident.”</span>
St. Thomas expressly teaches that, <span class="tei tei-q">“since it transcends
human nature, grace cannot be a substance nor a substantial form, but is
an accidental form of the soul itself.”</span><a id="noteref_988" name="noteref_988" href="#note_988"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">988</span></span></a>
Agreeable to this conception is the further Thomistic
teaching that sanctifying grace is not directly created by
God, but drawn (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">educta</span></span>)
from the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia obedientialis</span></span>
of the soul.<a id="noteref_989" name="noteref_989" href="#note_989"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">989</span></span></a> Not even the Scotists, though they held

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sanctifying Grace an Infused Habit.</span></span>—Sanctifying
grace may more specifically, though
with a lesser degree of certainty, be described
as a habit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus</span></span>).
Being entitatively supernatural,
this habit must be infused or <span class="tei tei-q">“drawn
out”</span> by the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Aristotle<a id="noteref_992" name="noteref_992" href="#note_992"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">992</span></span></a> distinguishes four different sets of qualities:
(1) habit and disposition; (2) power and incapacity;
(3) <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">passio</span></span>
(the power of causing sensations) and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patibilis
qualitas</span></span> (result of the modification of sense); (4) figure
and circumscribing form (of extended bodies). As
sanctifying grace manifestly cannot come under one of
the three last-mentioned heads, it must be either a habit or
a disposition. Habit denotes a permanent and comparatively
stable quality, by which a substance, considered as to
its nature or operation, is well or ill adapted to its natural
end.<a id="noteref_993" name="noteref_993" href="#note_993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">993</span></span></a> As a permanently inhering quality, sanctifying
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grace must be a habit. Hence its other name, <span class="tei tei-q">“habitual
grace.”</span> The Scholastics draw a distinction between
entitative and operative habits. An operative habit
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus operativus</span></span>)
gives not only the power (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potentia</span></span>)
to act, but also a certain facility, and may be either good,
bad, or indifferent. An entitative habit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus
entitativus</span></span>)
is an inherent quality by which a substance is
rendered permanently good or bad, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> beauty, ugliness,
health, disease.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Philosophy knows only operative habits. But sanctifying
grace affects the very substance of the soul. Hence
the supplementary theological category of entitative
habits. <span class="tei tei-q">“Grace,”</span> says St. Thomas, <span class="tei tei-q">“belongs to the first
species of quality, though it cannot properly be called a
habit, because it is not immediately ordained to action, but
to a kind of spiritual being, which it produces in the
soul.”</span><a id="noteref_994" name="noteref_994" href="#note_994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">994</span></span></a>
There is another reason why grace cannot be
called a habit in the philosophical sense of the term:—it
supplies no acquired facility to act. This consideration led
Suarez to abstain altogether from the use of the term
<span class="tei tei-q">“habit”</span> in connection with grace,<a id="noteref_995" name="noteref_995" href="#note_995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">995</span></span></a> and induced Cardinal
Bellarmine to describe sanctifying grace as a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">qualitas per
modum habitus</span></span>,<a id="noteref_996" name="noteref_996" href="#note_996"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">996</span></span></a> by which phrase he wished to indicate
that it imparts a supernatural perfection of being rather
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
than a facility to act. To obviate these and similar subtleties
the Council of Trent defined sanctifying grace simply
as a permanent quality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevertheless scientific theology employs the term
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus</span></span>
because it has no other philosophical category
ready to hand. This defect in the Aristotelian system
is somewhat surprising in view of the fact that besides
the supernatural, there are distinctly natural qualities
which <span class="tei tei-q">“belong to the first species,”</span> though they
impart no facility to act but merely a disposition to certain
modes of being, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> beauty, health, etc.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also a positive reason which justifies the definition
of sanctifying grace as a habit. It is that grace
imparts to the soul, if not the facility, at least the power
to perform supernaturally meritorious acts, so that it is
really more than a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus
entitativus</span></span>, namely, a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus</span></span>
(at least remotely)
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">operativus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_997" name="noteref_997" href="#note_997"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">997</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The Scholastic distinction between native and acquired
habits does not apply in the supernatural domain,
because the supernatural by its very definition can never
be either a part or an acquisition of mere nature.<a id="noteref_998" name="noteref_998" href="#note_998"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">998</span></span></a> It
follows from this that supernatural habits, both entitative
and operative, can be imparted to the human soul in no
other way than by infusion (or excitation) from above.
Hence the name <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus
infusus</span></span>. When the Holy Ghost
infuses sanctifying grace, the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus entitativus</span></span> imparts
to the soul a supernatural principle of being, while the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus operativus</span></span>
confers upon it a supernatural power,
which by faithful coöperation with (actual) grace may be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
developed into a facility to perform salutary acts. Hence,
if we adopt the division of habits into entitative and operative,
sanctifying grace must be defined first as an entitative
habit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus
entitativus</span></span>), because it forms the
groundwork of permanent righteousness, sanctity, divine
sonship, etc.; and, secondly, as an infused habit, because it
is not born in the soul and cannot be acquired by practice.
This view is in accord with Sacred Scripture, which describes
the grace of justification as a divine seed abiding
in man,<a id="noteref_999" name="noteref_999" href="#note_999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">999</span></span></a>

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Controversy Regarding the Alleged
Identity of Sanctifying Grace and
Charity.</span></span>—As justifying grace and theological
love (charity) are both infused habits, the question
arises as to their objective identity. The
answer will depend on the solution of the problem,
just treated, whether sanctifying grace is primarily
an entitative or an operative habit. Of
theological love we know that it is essentially an
operative habit, being one, and indeed the chief
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the <span class="tei tei-q">“three theological virtues.”</span> What we
have said in the preceding paragraph will enable
the reader to perceive, at the outset, that there
is a real distinction between grace and charity,
and that consequently the two can not be identical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Nevertheless there is an imposing school of
theologians who maintain the identity of grace
with charity. They are Scotus<a id="noteref_1003" name="noteref_1003" href="#note_1003"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1003</span></span></a> and his
followers,<a id="noteref_1004" name="noteref_1004" href="#note_1004"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1004</span></span></a>
Cardinal Bellarmine,<a id="noteref_1005" name="noteref_1005" href="#note_1005"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1005</span></span></a> Molina, Lessius, Salmeron,
Vasquez, Sardagna, Tournely, and others.
Their principal argument is that Holy Scripture
ascribes active justification indiscriminately to
theological love and sanctifying grace, and that
some of the Fathers follow this example. Here
are a few of the Scriptural texts quoted in favor
of this opinion. Luke VII, 47: <span class="tei tei-q">“Many sins are
forgiven her, because she hath loved much.”</span><a id="noteref_1006" name="noteref_1006" href="#note_1006"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1006</span></span></a>
1 Pet. IV, 8: <span class="tei tei-q">“Charity covereth a multitude of
sins.”</span><a id="noteref_1007" name="noteref_1007" href="#note_1007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1007</span></span></a>
1 John IV, 7: <span class="tei tei-q">“Every one that loveth
is born of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1008" name="noteref_1008" href="#note_1008"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1008</span></span></a> St. Augustine seems to identify
the two habits in such passages as the following:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Inchoate love, therefore, is inchoate
righteousness; ... great love is great righteousness;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
perfect love is perfect righteousness.”</span><a id="noteref_1009" name="noteref_1009" href="#note_1009"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1009</span></span></a>
According to the Tridentine Council, <span class="tei tei-q">“the justification
of the impious”</span> takes place when <span class="tei tei-q">“the charity
of God is poured forth ... in the hearts of those that are
justified, and is inherent therein.”</span><a id="noteref_1010" name="noteref_1010" href="#note_1010"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1010</span></span></a>
It is argued that, if charity and grace produce
the same effects, they must be identical as causes,
and there can be at most a virtual distinction between
them. This argument is strengthened by
the observation that sanctifying grace and theological
love constitute the supernatural life of the
soul and the loss of either entails spiritual death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These arguments prove that grace and charity are inseparable,
but nothing more. All the Scriptural and Patristic
passages cited can be explained without recourse to
the hypothesis that they are identical. Charity is not superfluous
alongside of sanctifying grace, because the primary
object of grace is to impart supernatural being,
whereas charity confers a special faculty which enables
the intellect and the will to elicit supernatural salutary
acts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) The majority of Catholic theologians<a id="noteref_1011" name="noteref_1011" href="#note_1011"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1011</span></span></a> hold
with St. Thomas<a id="noteref_1012" name="noteref_1012" href="#note_1012"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1012</span></span></a>
and his school that grace and
charity, while inseparable, are really distinct,
sanctifying grace as a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus entitativus</span></span> imparting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the soul a supernatural being, whereas
charity, being purely a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus
operativus</span></span>, confers
a supernatural power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us put the matter somewhat differently. Grace
inheres in the substance of the soul, while charity has its
seat in one of its several faculties. Inhering in the very
substance of the soul, grace, by a physical or moral power,
produces the three theological virtues—faith, hope, and
love. <span class="tei tei-q">“As the soul's powers, which are the wellsprings
of its acts, flow from its essence,”</span> says the Angelic Doctor,
<span class="tei tei-q">“so the theological virtues flow from grace into the
faculties of the soul and move them to act.”</span><a id="noteref_1013" name="noteref_1013" href="#note_1013"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1013</span></span></a> And
St. Augustine: <span class="tei tei-q">“Grace precedes charity.”</span><a id="noteref_1014" name="noteref_1014" href="#note_1014"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1014</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is a more plausible view than the one we
have examined a little farther up, and it can claim
the authority of Scripture, which, though it occasionally
identifies the effects of grace and charity,
always clearly distinguishes the underlying habits.
Cfr. 2 Cor. XIII, 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ and the charity of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1015" name="noteref_1015" href="#note_1015"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1015</span></span></a> 1 Tim. I
14: <span class="tei tei-q">“The grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly
with faith and love.”</span><a id="noteref_1016" name="noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a> Furthermore,
<span class="tei tei-q">“regeneration”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“new-creation”</span> in Biblical usage
affect not only the faculties of the soul, but its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
substance. Finally, many councils consistently
distinguish between <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia</span></span>
and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas</span></span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dona</span></span>,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtutes</span></span>)—a
distinction which has almost the force
of a proof that grace and charity are not the same
thing.<a id="noteref_1017" name="noteref_1017" href="#note_1017"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1017</span></span></a> These councils cannot have had in mind
a purely virtual distinction, because theological
love presupposes sanctifying grace in exactly the
same manner as a faculty presupposes a substance
or nature in which it exists. The Roman Catechism
expressly designates the theological virtues
as <span class="tei tei-q">“concomitants of grace.”</span><a id="noteref_1018" name="noteref_1018" href="#note_1018"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1018</span></span></a>

The question nevertheless remains an open one, as

the Soul in the Divine Nature.</span></span>—The highest
and at the same time the most profound conception

<span class="tei tei-q">“He justifies who is just of Himself, not from
another; and He deifies who is God of Himself, not by
participation in another. But He who justifies also
deifies, because He makes [men] sons of God through
justification.... We have been made sons of God and
gods; but this is a grace of the adopting [God], not the
nature of the progenitor. The Son of God alone is
God; ... the others who are made gods are made gods
by His grace; they are not born of His substance, so as
to become that which He is, but in order that they may
come to Him by favor and become co-heirs with
Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_1027" name="noteref_1027" href="#note_1027"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1027</span></span></a> The idea underlying this passage has found

were guilty of exaggeration when they taught that
grace transforms the human soul into the substance of
the Godhead, thus completely merging the creature in its
Creator. This contention<a id="noteref_1032" name="noteref_1032" href="#note_1032"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1032</span></span></a> leads to Pantheism. How
can the soul be merged in the Creator, since it continues
to be subject to concupiscence? <span class="tei tei-q">“We have
therefore,”</span> says St. Augustine, <span class="tei tei-q">“even now begun to be
like Him, as we have the first-fruits of the Spirit; but
yet even now we are unlike Him, by reason of the old
nature which leaves its remains in us. In as far, then,
as we are like Him, in so far are we, by the regenerating
Spirit, sons of God; but in as far as we are unlike Him,

On the other hand it would be underestimating the
power of grace to say that it effects a merely external
and moral participation of the soul in the divine nature,
similar to that by which those who embraced the faith of

c) Which one of God's numerous attributes
forms the basis of the supernatural communication
made to the soul in the bestowal of grace, is
a question on which theologians differ widely.
The so-called incommunicable attributes, (self-existence,

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

declares the essential characteristic of deification to be the
communication to the creature of the divine attributes
of self-existence and infinity. Self-existence is absolutely
incommunicable.<a id="noteref_1040" name="noteref_1040" href="#note_1040"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1040</span></span></a> Somewhat more plausible, though
hardly acceptable, is Ripalda's opinion that deification
formally consists in the participation of the creature in the
holiness of the Creator, particularly in the supernatural
vital communion of the soul with God in faith, hope, and
charity, thus making sanctifying grace the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">radix totius

supernatural life of the soul is a life in and through God,
and that the very concept of sanctifying grace involves a
peculiar and special relation of the soul to God, the Biblical
term κοινωνία θείας φύσεως points to a still deeper principle
of the sanctifying <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vita deiformis</span></span>. This
principle, as some of the Fathers intimate, and St. Thomas expressly
teaches,<a id="noteref_1042" name="noteref_1042" href="#note_1042"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1042</span></span></a> is the absolute intellectuality of God.
Hence the object of sanctifying grace is to impart to the
soul in a supernatural manner such a degree of intellectuality
as is necessary to perceive the absolute Spirit—here
on earth in the obscurity of faith, and in the life beyond by
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">lumen gloriae</span></span>.<a id="noteref_1043" name="noteref_1043" href="#note_1043"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1043</span></span></a> This view is to a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
certain extent confirmed by Sacred Scripture, which describes
the regeneration of the sinner as a birth of spirit
from spirit.<a id="noteref_1044" name="noteref_1044" href="#note_1044"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1044</span></span></a> It is also held by some of the Fathers,
who attribute to sanctifying grace both a deifying and
a spiritualizing power. Thus St. Basil<a id="noteref_1045" name="noteref_1045" href="#note_1045"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1045</span></span></a> says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
spirit-bearing souls, illuminated by the Holy Ghost,
themselves become spiritual<a id="noteref_1046" name="noteref_1046" href="#note_1046"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1046</span></span></a>
and radiate grace to others.
Hence ... to become like unto God,<a id="noteref_1047" name="noteref_1047" href="#note_1047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1047</span></span></a>

Finally, since the Holy Ghost,
as the highest exponent of the spirituality of the divine
nature, by His personal indwelling crowns and consummates
both the regeneration of the soul and its assimilation
to God, there is a strong theological probability in
favor of Suarez's view. Of course the process does not
attain its climax until the creature is finally admitted to
the beatific vision in Heaven. Cfr. 1 John III, 2: <span class="tei tei-q">“We
are now the sons of God, and it hath not yet appeared
what we shall be. We know that, when He shall appear,
we shall be like to Him, because we shall see Him as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall better understand the nature of sanctifying
grace by studying what are known as its <span class="tei tei-q">“formal effects.”</span>
As the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa
efficiens</span></span> of a thing is commonly farther removed
from our mental grasp than its effects, we are
ordinarily more familiar with the latter than with the
former. For this reason the glories of divine grace can be
best explained to children and to the faithful in general by
describing the effects it produces in the soul.<a id="noteref_1050" name="noteref_1050" href="#note_1050"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1050</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sanctity.</span></span>—The first among the formal effects
of sanctifying grace (an effect connoted by its
very name) is sanctity. Eph. IV, 24:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Put on the new man, who according to God is
created in justice and holiness of truth.”</span><a id="noteref_1051" name="noteref_1051" href="#note_1051"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1051</span></span></a> The
Tridentine Council explicitly mentions sanctity as
an effect of sanctifying grace: <span class="tei tei-q">“Justification ...
is not remission of sins merely, but also the
sanctification and renewal of the inward man
through the voluntary reception of the grace and
of the gifts whereby man from unjust becomes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
just.”</span><a id="noteref_1052" name="noteref_1052" href="#note_1052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1052</span></span></a> It follows that the two elements of active
justification, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: remission of sin and sanctification,
are also constitutive elements of habitual
or sanctifying grace. For it is precisely by the
infusion of sanctifying grace that sin is wiped out
and sanctity established in its place.<a id="noteref_1053" name="noteref_1053" href="#note_1053"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1053</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) By sanctifying grace the justified man becomes a
living member (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">membrum
vivum</span></span>) of the mystical body
of Christ. His sins, it is true, did not forfeit membership
in the Church, so long as he preserved the faith, but
by sinning he became a dead member who can regain life
only by returning to the state of grace. Grace is the
life of the soul, sin its death. Hence the evil of mortal
sin can be most effectively illustrated by contrast with the
glory of divine grace, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>. Cfr. Gal. II, 20:
<span class="tei tei-q">“And I live, now not I, but Christ liveth in me.”</span><a id="noteref_1054" name="noteref_1054" href="#note_1054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1054</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) He who hates mortal sin and faithfully obeys the
will of God, enjoys peace of heart,<a id="noteref_1055" name="noteref_1055" href="#note_1055"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1055</span></span></a> whereas the sinner is
incessantly harassed by qualms of conscience. The faithful
Christian rejoices in serving His Master and combats
the flesh, the world, and the devil with a fortitude that not
infrequently rises to heroic proportions, as the example
of many holy men and women proves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
c) Sanctifying grace entails a particular providence, inasmuch
as, by means of it, God grants man His special
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
assistance towards preserving the state of grace, without,
of course, interfering with free-will. Cfr. Is. XLIX, 16:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, I have graven thee in my hands.”</span><a id="noteref_1056" name="noteref_1056" href="#note_1056"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1056</span></span></a> Rom. VIII,
28: <span class="tei tei-q">“... to them that love God, all things work together
unto good.”</span><a id="noteref_1057" name="noteref_1057" href="#note_1057"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1057</span></span></a> Mediately, God also proves his
special love for the just man by shielding him from bodily
and spiritual danger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Supernatural Beauty.</span></span>—Though we can
quote no formal ecclesiastical definition to prove
that sanctifying grace beautifies the soul, the fact
is sufficiently certain from Revelation. If, as
is quite generally held by Catholic exegetes, the
Spouse of the Canticle typifies the human soul
endowed with sanctifying grace, all the passages
describing the beauty of that Spouse must be applicable
to the souls of those whom Christ embraces
with His tender love. The Fathers of
the Church frequently extol the supernatural
beauty of the soul in the state of grace. Ambrose
calls it <span class="tei tei-q">“a splendid painting made by God Himself;”</span>
Chrysostom compares it to <span class="tei tei-q">“a statue of
gold;”</span> Cyril, to <span class="tei tei-q">“a divine seal;”</span> Basil, to <span class="tei tei-q">“a shining
light,”</span> and so forth. St. Thomas says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine grace
beautifies [the soul] like light,”</span><a id="noteref_1058" name="noteref_1058" href="#note_1058"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1058</span></span></a>
and the Roman Catechism declares: <span class="tei tei-q">“Grace ...
is a certain splendor and light that effaces
all the stains of our souls and renders the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
souls themselves brighter and more
beautiful.”</span><a id="noteref_1059" name="noteref_1059" href="#note_1059"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1059</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In defining beauty as <span class="tei tei-q">“the representation of an
idea in a sensual form,”</span> modern aesthetics has eliminated
the spiritual element and in consequence is unable
to appreciate the spiritual beauty of God and of the
soul. Being composed of body and soul, man is naturally
most impressed by beauty when it appears in a material
guise. But this does not prove that there is no
spiritual beauty, or that true beauty abides solely in matter.
Some present-day writers strongly emphasize the
need of realism as against an idealism which, they
claim, is not truly human because it exalts the spiritual
at the expense of the material. In its last conclusions this
perverted realism harks back to the sophistry of Protagoras
who held that <span class="tei tei-q">“man is the measure of all things.”</span><a id="noteref_1060" name="noteref_1060" href="#note_1060"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1060</span></span></a>
Idealism, on the other hand, is based on the true
Platonic doctrine that God is the measure of all things.<a id="noteref_1061" name="noteref_1061" href="#note_1061"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1061</span></span></a>
St. Augustine defines beauty as <span class="tei tei-q">“unity in variety,”</span> which
is a correct definition, because it is adaptable to both
the spiritual and the material order.<a id="noteref_1062" name="noteref_1062" href="#note_1062"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1062</span></span></a> Applying this definition
we find that the soul is not only naturally beautiful
by the substantial unity and simplicity which shines forth
in the variety of its faculties and powers, but also supernaturally
by virtue of sanctifying grace, which transfuses
nature into a new unity with the supernatural,—at the
same time producing a variety of theological and moral
virtues and the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, and thus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
creating a true work of art. Moreover, by enabling
man to participate in the Divine Nature,<a id="noteref_1063" name="noteref_1063" href="#note_1063"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1063</span></span></a> grace produces
in the soul a physical reflection of the uncreated
beauty of God, a likeness of the creature with its Creator,
which far transcends the natural likeness imprinted by
creation. True, only God and the Elect in Heaven perceive
and enjoy this celestial beauty; but we terrestrial
pilgrims can, as it were, sense it from afar and indulge
the hope that we may one day be privileged to contemplate
and enjoy the divine beauty that envelops the souls endowed
with grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The beauty produced by sanctifying grace must be conceived
not merely as a reflection of the absolute nature of
God, who is the pattern-exemplar of all beauty, but more
specifically as an image of the Trinity impressed upon the
soul. St. Paul teaches that the soul is transformed into
an image of the Divine Logos, to whom, as the holy
Fathers tell us, beauty is appropriated in an especial manner.<a id="noteref_1064" name="noteref_1064" href="#note_1064"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1064</span></span></a>
Cfr. Rom. VIII, 29: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom he foreknew, he
also predestinated to be made conformable to the image
of his Son.”</span><a id="noteref_1065" name="noteref_1065" href="#note_1065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1065</span></span></a> Gal. IV, 19: <span class="tei tei-q">“My little children, of

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Friendship of God.</span></span>—Closely connected
with the beauty which sanctifying grace
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
confers, is the supernatural friendship it establishes
between God and the soul. True beauty
elicits love and benevolence. By nature man is
merely a servant of God; in fact, since the fall, he
is His enemy. Sanctifying grace transforms this
hostile relation into genuine friendship. By
grace, says the Council of Trent, <span class="tei tei-q">“man of unjust
becomes just, and of an enemy a friend.”</span><a id="noteref_1069" name="noteref_1069" href="#note_1069"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1069</span></span></a> And

the just man as His intimate friend and enables
and impels him, by means of habitual grace and
habitual charity, to reciprocate that love with
all his heart. Here we have the two constituent
elements of friendship. The Bible frequently
speaks of friendship existing between God and the
just. Cfr. Wisd. VII, 14: <span class="tei tei-q">“They [the just] become
the friends of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1071" name="noteref_1071" href="#note_1071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1071</span></span></a> John XV, 14 sq.:
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will not now call you servants, ... but I have
called you friends.”</span><a id="noteref_1072" name="noteref_1072" href="#note_1072"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1072</span></span></a> This friendship is sometimes
compared to a mystic marriage. Cfr.
Matth. IX, 15: <span class="tei tei-q">“And Jesus said to them: Can
the children of the bridegroom mourn, as long as
the bridegroom is with them?”</span><a id="noteref_1073" name="noteref_1073" href="#note_1073"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1073</span></span></a> Apoc. XIX, 7:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) Friendship (φιλία), according to Aristotle,<a id="noteref_1075" name="noteref_1075" href="#note_1075"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1075</span></span></a> is <span class="tei tei-q">“the
conscious love of benevolence of two persons for each
other.”</span> Hence, to constitute friendship, there must be
(1) two or more distinct persons; (2) pure love of benevolence
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">(amor benevolentiae</span></span>,
not <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">concupiscentiae</span></span>), because
only unselfish love can truly unite hearts; (3)
mutual consciousness of affection, because without a
consciousness of the existing relation on both sides
there would be merely one-sided benevolence, not friendship.
It follows that true friendship is based on virtue
and that a relation not based on virtue can be called
friendship in a qualified or metaphorical sense only
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">amicitia utilis,
delectabilis</span></span>).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From what we have said it is easy to deduce the essential
characteristics of true friendship. They are: (1)
benevolence; (2) love consciously entertained by both
parties; (3) a mutual exchange of goods or community of
life; (4) equality of rank or station. The first condition
is based on the fact that a true friend will not seek his
own interest, but that of his friend. It is to be noted,
however, that one's joy at the presence or prosperity of a
friend must not be inspired by selfishness or sensual desire,
for in that case there would be no true friendship.<a id="noteref_1076" name="noteref_1076" href="#note_1076"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1076</span></span></a>
The second condition is based on the necessity of friendship
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
being mutual love, for friendship is not a one-sided
affection, nor does it spend itself in mutual admiration.
The third condition is necessary for the reason that love,
if it is to be more than <span class="tei tei-q">“Platonic,”</span> must result in acts
of benevolence and good will.<a id="noteref_1077" name="noteref_1077" href="#note_1077"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1077</span></span></a> Of the fourth condition
St. Jerome says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Friendship finds men equal or
makes them equal.”</span><a id="noteref_1078" name="noteref_1078" href="#note_1078"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1078</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) All these conditions are found in the friendship
with which Almighty God deigns to honor those who are
in the state of sanctifying grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) That God loves the just man with a love of
pure benevolence and eagerly seeks his companionship, is
proved by the mysteries of the Incarnation and the Holy
Eucharist. Cfr. Prov. VIII, 31: <span class="tei tei-q">“And my delight [is]
to be with the children of men.”</span><a id="noteref_1079" name="noteref_1079" href="#note_1079"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1079</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) The just man is enabled to return God's love by
the habit of theological charity, which is inseparably
bound up with and spontaneously flows from sanctifying
grace.<a id="noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080" href="#note_1080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a>
God's consciousness of this mutual love is, of
course, based on certain knowledge, whereas man can
have merely a probable conjecture. This, however, suffices
to establish a true friendship, as the example of human
friends shows.<a id="noteref_1081" name="noteref_1081" href="#note_1081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1081</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) There is also community of life and property between
God and man when the latter is in the state of sanctifying
grace; for not only is he indebted to God for his
very nature and all natural favors which he enjoys, but
likewise and especially for the supernatural blessings bestowed
upon him.<a id="noteref_1082" name="noteref_1082" href="#note_1082"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1082</span></span></a>
On his own part, it is true, he cannot
give his Benefactor anything in return which that
Benefactor does not already possess; but the just man is
ever eager to further God's external glorification, agreeable
to the first petition of the Our Father: <span class="tei tei-q">“Hallowed
by Thy name.”</span><a id="noteref_1083" name="noteref_1083" href="#note_1083"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1083</span></span></a>
God has furthermore given him a kind
of substitute for operative charity in the love of his neighbor,
which has precisely the same formal object as the
love of God. Cfr. 1 John III, 17: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that hath the
substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need,
and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the
charity of God abide in him?”</span><a id="noteref_1084" name="noteref_1084" href="#note_1084"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1084</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) There can be no real equality between God and the
human soul, but God in His infinite goodness, elevating
the soul to a higher plane and allowing it to participate

4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Adoptive Sonship.</span></span>—The formal effects of
sanctifying grace culminate in the elevation of
man to the rank of an adopted child of God (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">filius
Dei adoptivus</span></span>), with a claim to the paternal inheritance,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the beatific vision in Heaven. This
truth is so clearly stated in Scripture and Tradition
that its denial would be heretical. The Tridentine
Council summarily describes justification
as <span class="tei tei-q">“the state of grace and of the adoption of the
sons of God,”</span><a id="noteref_1087" name="noteref_1087" href="#note_1087"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1087</span></span></a> The teaching of Holy Scripture
can be gathered from such texts as the following.
Rom. VIII, 15 sqq.: <span class="tei tei-q">“... You have received
the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry:
Abba (Father). For the spirit himself giveth
testimony to our spirit, that we are the sons of
God. And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God,
and joint heirs with Christ.”</span><a id="noteref_1088" name="noteref_1088" href="#note_1088"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1088</span></span></a> 1 John III, 1 sq.:

sons of God follows likewise as a corollary
from the doctrine of regeneration so frequently
taught by Scripture. This regeneration
is not a procession of the soul from the divine
essence, but a kind of accidental and analogical
procreation substantially identical with adoption
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">filiatio adoptiva</span></span>,
υἱοθεσία). Cfr. John I, 12 sq.:

a) St. Thomas defines adoption as <span class="tei tei-q">“the gratuitous acceptance
of a child of other parents to be the same as

the adopted child be a stranger to the adopting father;
(2) that it have no legal claim to adoption; (3) that it
give its consent to being adopted; (4) that it be received
by the adopting father with parental love and affection.
All these elements are present, in a far higher and more
perfect form, in the adoption of a soul by God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) The rational creature, as such, is not a <span class="tei tei-q">“son”</span> but

of mortal sin, His enemy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) That adoption is a gratuitous favor on the part of
the Almighty, follows from the fact that the adopted
creature is His enemy and that grace is a free supernatural
gift, to which no creature has a natural claim.
Adoption furthermore implies the right of inheritance.<a id="noteref_1094" name="noteref_1094" href="#note_1094"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1094</span></span></a>

The heritage of the children of God is a purely
spiritual possession which can be enjoyed simultaneously
by many, and consequently excels every natural heritage.
Men, as a rule, do not distribute their property during
life, while, after their death, it is usually divided up
among several heirs.<a id="noteref_1095" name="noteref_1095" href="#note_1095"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1095</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) Whereas adoption among men owes its existence
to the desire of offspring on the part of childless parents,
the adoption of the soul by God springs from pure benevolence
and unselfish love, and for this reason presupposes
(in the case of adults) the free consent of
the adopted. No one can become an adopted son of
God against his will.<a id="noteref_1096" name="noteref_1096" href="#note_1096"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1096</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) Whereas human adoption supposes substantial
equality between father and child, and therefore at best
amounts to no more than a legal acceptance, adoption by
God elevates the soul to a higher level by allowing it to
participate in the Divine Nature, and consequently is a
true (even though merely an accidental and analogical) regeneration
in God.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) From what we have said it follows—and this is a
truth of considerable speculative importance—that there
are essential points of difference as well as of resemblance
between Jesus Christ, the true Son of God, and the justified
sinner adopted by the Heavenly Father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The difference between the <span class="tei tei-q">“natural Son of God”</span>
and an <span class="tei tei-q">“adopted son”</span> is exactly like that between God
and creature. The Logos-Son, engendered by eternal
generation from the divine substance, is the true natural
Son of the Father, the Second Person of the Divine
Trinity, and Himself God.<a id="noteref_1097" name="noteref_1097" href="#note_1097"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1097</span></span></a> The just man, on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other hand, is a child of God merely by the possession
of sanctifying grace,<a id="noteref_1098" name="noteref_1098" href="#note_1098"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1098</span></span></a> which can be lost by mortal
sin and consequently is founded upon a free relation that
may be terminated by man as freely as it was entered
into between himself and God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Intimately related to this distinction is another:—Christ
is the Son of the Father alone, the just man is
an adopted child of the whole Trinity.<a id="noteref_1099" name="noteref_1099" href="#note_1099"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1099</span></span></a> This fact does
not, however, prevent us from <span class="tei tei-q">“appropriating”</span> adoptive
sonship to each of the three Divine Persons according
to His peculiar hypostatic character:—the
Father as its author, the Son as its pattern, and the Holy
Ghost as its conveyor.<a id="noteref_1100" name="noteref_1100" href="#note_1100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1100</span></span></a> Now, if Christ, as the true Son
of God, is the efficient cause (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa
efficiens</span></span>) of that
adoptive sonship of which, as God, He is also the pattern-exemplar
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa exemplaris</span></span>), it follows that He cannot
be an adopted son of God. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Christus
est incapax adoptionis</span></span>,”</span>
as Suarez puts it.<a id="noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101" href="#note_1101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a> To say that He is both the
natural and an adopted Son of God would be heretical.<a id="noteref_1102" name="noteref_1102" href="#note_1102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1102</span></span></a>
Consequently, sanctifying grace, in Him, did not exercise
one of the functions it invariably exercises in the souls of
men, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> it did not make Him an adopted son of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) It is to be noted, however, that the unique position
enjoyed by our Lord gives rise, not only to essential
distinctions but also to an equal number of analogies between
the Only-begotten Son of God and His adopted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sons. The first and most fundamental of these analogies
is the attribution of the common appellation <span class="tei tei-q">“son of
God”</span> both to Christ and to the just. Though Christ
is the only true Son of God, the Heavenly Father
has nevertheless charitably <span class="tei tei-q">“bestowed upon us, that we
should be called, and should be, the sons of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103" href="#note_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a> According
to John I, 13, Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“gave power to be made the
sons of God”</span> to them <span class="tei tei-q">“who are born ... of God.”</span>
Hence divine sonship formally consists in an impression
of the hypostatic likeness of the Only-begotten Son of
God, by which the soul in a mysterious manner becomes
an image of the Trinity, and especially of the Only-begotten
Son of God, who is the archetype and pattern-exemplar
of adoptive sonship. This hypostatic propriety
and exemplariness was the reason why the Second Person
of the Trinity became man.<a id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104" href="#note_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1104</span></span></a> That the soul of the
justified is transformed into <span class="tei tei-q">“an image of the Son of
God”</span> is expressly taught by the Greek Fathers. Thus
St. Cyril of Alexandria says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ is truly formed
in us, inasmuch as the Holy Ghost impresses on us a
certain divine likeness by means of sanctity and justice....
But if any one is formed in Christ, he is formed into
a child of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105" href="#note_1105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These considerations also explain the points of resemblance
between the adoptive sonship of God and the Holy
Eucharist. Being our Father by adoption, God is bound
to provide us with food worthy of a divine progenitor.
The food He gives us (the Holy Eucharist) corresponds
to our dignity as His children, sustains us in this sublime
relation, and at the same time constitutes the pledge of a
glorious resurrection and an eternal beatitude.

c) Is the adoptive sonship of the children of God constituted
entirely by sanctifying grace, or does it require
for its full development the personal indwelling in the
soul of the Holy Ghost?<a id="noteref_1106" name="noteref_1106" href="#note_1106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1106</span></span></a>
This subtle question formed
the subject of an interesting controversy between Joseph
Scheeben and Theodore Granderath, S. J. Father
Granderath claimed on the authority of the Tridentine

sanctifying grace, and through that grace alone, without
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inhabitatio

formalis</span></span> of justification. Against this theory Dr.
Scheeben maintained with great acumen and, we think,
successfully, that sanctifying grace of itself alone, without
the aid of any other factor, not only completely justifies
the sinner but raises him to the rank of an adopted
son of God, though there is nothing to prevent us from
holding that the indwelling of the Holy Ghost forms the
climax of the process, and develops and perfects the
already existing <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">filiatio

Petavius had contended<a id="noteref_1108" name="noteref_1108" href="#note_1108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a> that the just men of the Old

as inseparable formal effects of sanctifying grace.
There can no longer be any doubt, therefore, that the

<h4 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.00em; margin-top: 2.00em">Article 3. The Supernatural Concomitants Of Sanctifying Grace</h4>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides producing the effects described in the
preceding Article, sanctifying grace also confers
certain supernatural privileges, which, though not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the essence of grace, are, in the present economy
at least, inseparably connected with it and
may therefore be regarded as its regular concomitants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The existence of these privileges is established
by the fact that certain councils (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> those of
Vienne and Trent), couple <span class="tei tei-q">“grace and gifts”</span> in
their official definitions.<a id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111" href="#note_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a> The doctrine is clearly
stated by the Roman Catechism as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“To
this [sanctifying grace] is added a most noble accompaniment
of all virtues, which are divinely
infused into the soul together with grace.”</span><a id="noteref_1112" name="noteref_1112" href="#note_1112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1112</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will treat of the supernatural concomitants
of sanctifying grace in four theses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Thesis I: The three divine virtues of faith, hope,
and charity are infused into the soul simultaneously
with sanctifying grace.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some theologians (notably Suarez, Ripalda, and De
Lugo) declare this thesis to be
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de fide</span></span>, while others
(Dom. Soto, Melchior Cano, and Vasquez) hold it
merely as certain. Under the circumstances it will be
safest to take middle ground by characterizing it
as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fidei
proxima</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. The Council of Trent teaches: <span class="tei tei-q">“Man
through Jesus Christ, in whom he is ingrafted, receives,
in the said justification, together with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
remission of sins, all these [gifts] infused at once—faith,
hope, and charity.”</span><a id="noteref_1113" name="noteref_1113" href="#note_1113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1113</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) That theological charity, as a habit, is infused
together with sanctifying grace can be convincingly
demonstrated from Holy Scripture.
Cfr. Rom. V, 5: <span class="tei tei-q">“... the charity of God is
poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who
is given to us.”</span><a id="noteref_1114" name="noteref_1114" href="#note_1114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1114</span></span></a> In connection with charity,
Holy Scripture frequently mentions faith. Cfr. 1
Cor. XIII, 2: <span class="tei tei-q">“And if I should have ... all
faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have
not charity, I am nothing.”</span><a id="noteref_1115" name="noteref_1115" href="#note_1115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1115</span></span></a> All three of the
theological virtues are expressly enumerated in 1
Cor. XIII, 13: <span class="tei tei-q">“And now there remain faith,
hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of
these is charity.”</span><a id="noteref_1116" name="noteref_1116" href="#note_1116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1116</span></span></a> Unlike certain other texts,
the one last quoted leaves no doubt that faith,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hope, and charity are to be conceived as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">dona
inhaerentia</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> habits or qualities inherent in the
soul. This interpretation is approved by the Fathers
and Scholastics.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) St. Thomas proves the necessity of the three theological
virtues for salvation as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“In order that
we be properly moved towards our end [God], that end
must be both known and desired. Desire of an end includes
two things: first, hope of attaining it, because no
prudent man will aspire to that which he cannot attain;
and secondly, love, because nothing is desired that is not
loved. And hence there are three theological virtues,—faith,
by which we know God; hope, by which we trust to obtain Him; and
charity, by which we love Him.”</span><a id="noteref_1117" name="noteref_1117" href="#note_1117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1117</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When are the three theological virtues infused into the
soul? This is an open question so far as faith and hope
are concerned. Of charity we know that it is always infused
with habitual grace. Suarez contends that, when
the soul is properly disposed, faith and hope are infused
before justification proper, that is to say, in the process
leading up to it. St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure,
on the other hand, hold that faith and hope, like charity,
are infused at the moment when justification actually
takes place in the soul. This last-mentioned opinion is
favored by the Tridentine Council.<a id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118" href="#note_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mortal sin first destroys sanctifying grace together with
the habit of charity that is inseparable from it. Faith
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and hope may continue to exist in the soul, and if hope,
too, departs, faith may remain alone. But the loss of
faith invariably entails the destruction of hope and
charity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Thesis II: Together with sanctifying grace there
are also infused the supernatural moral virtues.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This proposition may be characterized as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sententia
communior et probabilior</span></span>. Though denied by some theologians,
it can claim a high degree of probability.<a id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119" href="#note_1119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1119</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. The infused moral virtues (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">virtutes
morales infusae</span></span>) differ from the theological virtues
in that they have for their immediate formal
object, not God Himself, but the creature in its
relation to the moral law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The moral virtues may be reduced to four, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: prudence,
justice, fortitude, and temperance. These are
called the <span class="tei tei-q">“cardinal”</span> virtues; first, because they perfect
the principal faculties of the soul; secondly, because all
the other virtues may be scientifically deduced from
them.<a id="noteref_1120" name="noteref_1120" href="#note_1120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1120</span></span></a> In the supernatural order the infusion of the
cardinal virtues and of the other virtues subordinate to
them has for its object the government of intellect and
will in their relation towards created things and the
guidance of these faculties to their supernatural end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) The existence of supernaturally infused
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moral virtues is intimated in Wis. VIII, 7: <span class="tei tei-q">“And
if a man love justice: her labors have great virtues;
for she teacheth temperance, and prudence,
and justice, and fortitude, which are such things
as men can have nothing more profitable in life.”</span><a id="noteref_1121" name="noteref_1121" href="#note_1121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1121</span></span></a>
The teacher of the three cardinal virtues here
mentioned is <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Wisdom,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> God Himself,
and we may assume that He inculcates them
by the same method which He employs in infusing
the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another relevant text is Ezechiel XI, 19 sq.:
<span class="tei tei-q">“... and I will take away the stony heart out of
their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh, that
they may walk in my commandments, and keep
my judgments.”</span><a id="noteref_1122" name="noteref_1122" href="#note_1122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a> Here Yahweh promises to
give the just men of the New Covenant a <span class="tei tei-q">“heart
of flesh”</span> as opposed to the <span class="tei tei-q">“stony heart”</span> of the
Jews. The meaning evidently is that a disposition
to do good will be a characteristic of the New Testament
Christians in contradistinction to the hardhearted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Old Testament Jews. He who has a
<span class="tei tei-q">“heart of flesh”</span> will walk in God's commandments
and keep His judgments. Hence <span class="tei tei-q">“heart”</span> signifies
the sum-total of all those habits which impel
and enable a man to lead a good life. Since it is
God Himself who gives the <span class="tei tei-q">“heart of flesh,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
the moral virtues, it follows that they are supernaturally
infused.<a id="noteref_1123" name="noteref_1123" href="#note_1123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1123</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) Some of the Fathers ascribe the moral virtues
directly to divine infusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus St. Augustine observes that the cardinal virtues
<span class="tei tei-q">“are given to us through the grace of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1124" name="noteref_1124" href="#note_1124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1124</span></span></a> And St.
Gregory the Great says that the Holy Ghost does <span class="tei tei-q">“not
desert the hearts of those who are perfect in faith, hope,
and charity, and in those other goods without which no
man can attain to the heavenly fatherland.”</span><a id="noteref_1125" name="noteref_1125" href="#note_1125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1125</span></span></a> St.
Thomas shows the theological reason for this by pointing
to the parallel that exists between nature and the supernatural.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Effects,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“must always be proportionate
to their causes and principles. Now all virtues,
intellectual and moral, which we acquire by our acts, proceed
from certain natural principles preëxisting in
us.... In lieu of these natural principles God confers
on us the theological virtues, by which we are directed to
a supernatural end.... Hence there must correspond
to these theological virtues, proportionally, other habits
caused in us by God, and which bear the same relation to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the theological virtues that the moral and intellectual virtues
bear to the natural principles of virtue.”</span><a id="noteref_1126" name="noteref_1126" href="#note_1126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1126</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-weight: 700">Thesis III: The seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are
also infused with sanctifying grace.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This proposition may be qualified as
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">probabilis</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Proof. The Church's teaching with regard to the seven
gifts of the Holy Ghost is based on Isaias XI, 2 sq.:
<span class="tei tei-q">“And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him: the spirit
of wisdom, and of understanding, the spirit of counsel, and
of fortitude, the spirit of knowledge, and of godliness.
And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the
Lord.”</span> Four of these supernatural gifts (wisdom, understanding,
counsel, and knowledge) perfect the intellect
in matters pertaining to salvation, while the remaining
three (fortitude, godliness, and the fear of the Lord)
direct the will to its supernatural end. Are these seven
gifts, (or some of them), really distinct from the infused
moral virtues? Are they habits or habitual dispositions,
or merely transient impulses or inspirations? What are
their mutual relations and how can they be divided off
from one another? These and similar questions are in
dispute among theologians. The prevailing opinion is
that the gifts of the Holy Ghost are infused habitual dispositions,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">realiter</span></span> distinct from the theological and
moral virtues, by which the soul is endowed with a supernatural
capacity for receiving the inspirations of the Holy Ghost
and a supernatural readiness to obey His impulses in all
important matters pertaining to salvation.<a id="noteref_1127" name="noteref_1127" href="#note_1127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1127</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the gifts of the Holy Ghost are infused into the
soul simultaneously with sanctifying grace, can be
demonstrated as follows: Christ, as the mystical head, is
the pattern of justification for the members of His spiritual
body, who are united to Him by sanctifying grace.<a id="noteref_1128" name="noteref_1128" href="#note_1128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1128</span></span></a>
Now the Holy Ghost dwelled in Christ with all His gifts
as permanent habits.<a id="noteref_1129" name="noteref_1129" href="#note_1129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1129</span></span></a> Consequently, these gifts are imparted
by infusion to those who receive the grace of justification.

β) Agreeable to this teaching of Scripture the
Fathers, especially those of the East, assert the
substantial indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the
souls of the just.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fact that no one but God can dwell substantially
and personally in a creature was cited by the Greek Fathers
in their controversies with the Pneumatomachians
to prove the divinity of the Holy Ghost. St. Athanasius
writes to Serapion:<a id="noteref_1137" name="noteref_1137" href="#note_1137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1137</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“If we by receiving the Holy
Ghost are allowed to participate in the Divine Nature,
no one but a fool will assert that the Holy Ghost is not
of divine but of human nature. For all those in whom He

for no other reason. But if He
constitutes them gods, there can be no doubt that His
nature is divine.”</span> St. Basil comments as follows on Ps.
LXXXI, 6 (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego dixi,

The Latin Fathers, with one exception, are less definite
on this point. St. Augustine says that the Holy
Ghost <span class="tei tei-q">“is given as a gift of God in such a way that He
Himself also gives Himself as being God,”</span><a id="noteref_1141" name="noteref_1141" href="#note_1141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1141</span></span></a> and that
<span class="tei tei-q">“the grace of God is a gift of God, but the greatest gift
is the Holy Spirit Himself, who therefore is called a
grace.”</span><a id="noteref_1142" name="noteref_1142" href="#note_1142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1142</span></span></a>

b) While theologians are unanimous in accepting
the doctrine of the personal indwelling of
the Holy Ghost in the just as clearly contained in
Sacred Scripture and Tradition, they differ in explaining
the manner in which He dwells in the
soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) The great majority hold that the Holy Ghost can not
dwell in the soul, as the human soul dwells in the body,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per modum
informationis</span></span>, nor yet by a hypostatic union,
as godhead and manhood dwell together in the Person of
Christ; and that consequently His indwelling is objectively
an indwelling of the whole Trinity, which is appropriated
to the Third Person merely because the Holy Ghost is
<span class="tei tei-q">“hypostatic holiness”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“personal love.”</span> This view
is based on what is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the fundamental law of the
Trinity,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“In God all things are one except
where there is opposition of relation.”</span><a id="noteref_1144" name="noteref_1144" href="#note_1144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1144</span></span></a> Sacred Scripture
speaks of the personal indwelling of the Father
and the Son as well as of the Holy Ghost. Cfr. John
XIV, 23: <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one love me, he will keep my word,
and my Father will love him, and we will come to him
and will make our abode with him.”</span><a id="noteref_1145" name="noteref_1145" href="#note_1145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1145</span></span></a> St. Athanasius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
concludes from these words that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">energia</span></span> of the
Trinity is one.... Indeed when the Lord says: I and
the Father will come, the Spirit also comes, to dwell in us
in precisely the same manner in which the Son dwells in
us.”</span><a id="noteref_1146" name="noteref_1146" href="#note_1146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1146</span></span></a>
And St. Augustine teaches: <span class="tei tei-q">“Love, therefore,
which is of God and is God, is properly the Holy Spirit,
by whom the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts,—that
love by which the whole Trinity dwells in us.”</span><a id="noteref_1147" name="noteref_1147" href="#note_1147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1147</span></span></a>
Accordingly, the personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost
consists in the state of grace as bearing a special relation to
the Third Person of the Trinity; the <span class="tei tei-q">“higher nature”</span>
which sanctifying grace imparts to the soul is not an
absolute but a relative form (σχέσις), by which the
soul is mysteriously united with the Three Divine Persons
and, by appropriation, with the Holy Ghost, thereby
becoming a throne and temple of God. It is in this sense
that the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the soul is called
the climax of justification.<a id="noteref_1148" name="noteref_1148" href="#note_1148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1148</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) Other eminent theologians (Petavius, Passaglia,
Schrader, Scheeben, Hurter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et al.</span></span>) regard the explanation
just given as unsatisfactory. They contend that the
Fathers, especially those of the East, conceived the indwelling
of the Holy Ghost in the souls of the just, not
as an indwelling (ἐνοίκησις) of the Trinity, appropriated
to the Holy Ghost, but as a union (ἕνωσις) of the Holy
Ghost Himself with the soul.<a id="noteref_1149" name="noteref_1149" href="#note_1149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1149</span></span></a> This union, they say, is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
neither physical nor hypostatic, but an altogether unique
and inexplicable relation by which the soul is morally, accidentally,
and actively united to the person of the Holy
Ghost.<a id="noteref_1150" name="noteref_1150" href="#note_1150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1150</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
γ) Unfortunately this exalted and mystic theory cannot
be squared with the theological principles underlying
the Catholic teaching on the Trinity, especially that portion
of it which concerns the appropriations and missions
of the three Divine Persons.<a id="noteref_1151" name="noteref_1151" href="#note_1151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1151</span></span></a> It is true that sanctifying
grace culminates in a communication of the Divine
Nature, and that this θείωσις is effected by imprinting upon
the soul an image of the divine processes of generation
and spiration,—the first by adoptive filiation, the second
by an indwelling of the Holy Ghost.<a id="noteref_1152" name="noteref_1152" href="#note_1152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1152</span></span></a> In fact all the
Trinitarian relations are reflected in the justification of the
sinner. Thus regeneration corresponds to the generation
of the Logos by the Father; adoptive sonship and the
accompanying participation of the soul in the Divine Nature
corresponds to our Lord's natural sonship and his
consubstantiality with the Father; the indwelling of the
Holy Ghost and His union with the soul, on the other
hand, corresponds to the divine process of Spiration, inasmuch
as it is preëminently a supernatural union of love
and effects a sort of mutual inexistence or perichoresis
of the soul in the Holy Ghost or the three Divine Persons
respectively.<a id="noteref_1153" name="noteref_1153" href="#note_1153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1153</span></span></a> Since, however, this union of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
soul with the substance of the three Divine Persons in
general, and the Holy Ghost in particular, is not a substantial
and physical but only an accidental and moral
union, the regeneration of the sinner must be conceived
as generation in a metaphorical sense only, divine sonship
as adoptive sonship, the deification of man as a
weak imitation of the divine <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">homoousia</span></span>,
and the indwelling
of the Holy Spirit in the soul as a shadowy analogue
of the Divine Perichoresis.<a id="noteref_1154" name="noteref_1154" href="#note_1154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1154</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By a property (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">proprium</span></span>, ἴδιον) we understand
a quality which, though not part of the essence of
a thing, necessarily flows from that essence by
some sort of causation and is consequently found
in all individuals of the same species.<a id="noteref_1155" name="noteref_1155" href="#note_1155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1155</span></span></a> A property,
as such, is opposed to an accident (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">accidens</span></span>,
συμβεβηκός), which is neither part of, nor necessarily
attached to, the essence, but may or may not
be present in the individual. Thus the ability to
laugh is a property of human nature, whereas the
color of the skin is an accident.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How do the properties of grace differ from its
formal effects, and from its supernatural concomitants?
The formal effects of grace, as we have
seen, are the elements constituting its nature, the
properties are determinations necessarily flowing
from that nature, while the supernatural concomitants
are free gifts superadded by God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to the Protestant theory, justification is absolutely
certain, equal in all men, and incapable of being lost.
The Catholic Church, on the contrary, teaches that justification
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is (1) uncertain, (2) unequal, and (3) amissible.

of the dogma embodied in our thesis.

α) The purpose of this dogma is not, as Harnack<a id="noteref_1166" name="noteref_1166" href="#note_1166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1166</span></span></a>
thinks, <span class="tei tei-q">“partly to assuage and partly to excite the restlessness
that still remains, by means of the sacraments, indulgences,
liturgical worship and ecclesiastical encouragement
of mystical and monkish practices,”</span> but to prevent undue
security and careless assurance. What the Church condemns,
in accordance with Sacred Scripture and Tradition,
is the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">certitudo

Tridentine Council, <span class="tei tei-q">“even so each one, when he regards
himself and his own weakness and indisposition, may
have fear and apprehension touching his own grace; seeing
that no one can know with a certainty of faith, which
cannot be subject to error, that he has obtained the grace

One needs but to apply to theology the epistemological
principles and criteria furnished by philosophy to perceive
that the Catholic dogma is as reasonable as the Protestant
theory is absurd. The Protestant syllogism: <span class="tei tei-q">“I know
with a certainty of faith that the penitent sinner who
does his share, is justified through the grace of Christ;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
now, I, who am a penitent sinner, know with a certainty
of faith that I have done my share; therefore, I know
with a certainty of faith that I am justified,”</span> may be
formally correct, but the minor premise embodies a material
error, because no man knows with a certainty of
faith that he has done his share, unless it be specially
revealed to him by God. No matter how sure I may feel
of my own goodness, I have no certainty of faith, such
as that which Mary Magdalen had, or that which was
vouchsafed to the penitent thief on the cross, that I am
justified. It is one of the approved rules of syllogistic
reasoning that <span class="tei tei-q">“the conclusion must follow the weaker
premiss.”</span><a id="noteref_1168" name="noteref_1168" href="#note_1168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1168</span></span></a> Hence, in the above syllogism the certainty
cannot be of faith, but human and moral only. We do
not mean to deny that God may grant to this or that individual
a certainty of faith with regard to his justification;
in fact theologians expressly teach that in such a rare and
exceptional case the privileged person would be obliged to
believe in his own justification,

β) Can any one, without a special revelation, be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">theologically</span></em>
certain that he is justified? Theological certainty

which embodies an article of faith in one of its premises

holding that there are rare cases in which men do
have a theological certainty as to their justification without
a private revelation. All other writers deny the

countenance the proposition; (2) because there are no
criteria available for such certainty outside of private

γ) For precisely the same reasons no man can be
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphysically</span></em> certain of his own justification. Hence
there remains only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral</span></em> certainty. Moral certainty
admits of varying degrees. The highest degree of moral
certainty concerning justification can be had in the case of
baptized infants, though, of course, we can never be
metaphysically certain even in regard to them, because
there is always room for doubt as to the intention of the
minister and the validity of the matter and form
employed in the administration of the sacrament. In the
case of adults, certainty regarding justification varies in
proportion to the measure in which it can be ascertained
whether one has complied with all the requirements demanded
by God. However, certainty may be so great as

Proof. The Protestant contention that the
grace of justification is shared in an equal measure
by all the justified, was a logical deduction
from Luther's false principle that men are justified
by faith alone through the external justice of
Christ. If this were true, good works would be
superfluous, and all Christians would enjoy an
equal measure of grace. Luther formally asserted
this in his sermon on the nativity of the
Blessed Virgin: <span class="tei tei-q">“All we who are Christians are equally great
and holy with the Mother of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1175" name="noteref_1175" href="#note_1175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1175</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The Catholic Church rejects this teaching. She
holds that justification is an intrinsic process by
which the justice and holiness of Christ becomes
our own through sanctifying grace, and that consequently
sanctifying grace may be present in the
soul in a greater or less degree, according to the
liberality of God and the disposition of the individual
Christian, and those who are in the state of
grace may augment it by good works. The Council
of Trent formally defines these truths when
it says: <span class="tei tei-q">“[We receive] justice within us, each
one according to his own measure, which the Holy
Ghost distributes to every one as He wills, and according
to each one's proper disposition and coöperation.”</span><a id="noteref_1176" name="noteref_1176" href="#note_1176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1176</span></span></a>

The second and more important of
these truths is re-iterated and emphasized in the
canons of Session VI: <span class="tei tei-q">“If anyone saith that the
justice received is not preserved and also increased
before God through good works, but that those
works are merely the fruits and signs of justification

When Jovinian attempted to revive the Stoic theory

with strenuous opposition on the part of St. Jerome,
who wrote a special treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contra Iovinianum</span></span>, in which
he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Each of us receives grace according to the
measure of the grace of Christ (Eph. IV, 7); not as if
the measure of Christ were unequal, but so much of His grace is infused into
us as we are capable of receiving.”</span><a id="noteref_1185" name="noteref_1185" href="#note_1185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1185</span></span></a>
St. Augustine teaches that the just are as
unequal as the sinners. <span class="tei tei-q">“The saints are clad with justice
(Job XXIX, 14), some more, some less; and no one on

best is he who has least.”</span><a id="noteref_1186" name="noteref_1186" href="#note_1186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1186</span></span></a> But, we are told, life as
such is not capable of being increased; how then can
there be an increase of spiritual life? St. Thomas answers
this objection as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The natural life pertains
to the substance of man, and therefore can be neither
augmented nor diminished; but in the life of grace man
participates <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">accidentaliter</span></span>,

c) From what we have said it is easy to understand
the distinction which theologians make between

as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia

(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">iustificatio</span></span>, δικαίωσις) partly because

imply true sanctification.

In this connection the question may be raised whether
sanctifying grace is diminished by venial sin. Venial sin
does not destroy the state of grace and consequently
cannot augment or diminish grace. To assume that it
could, would lead to the absurd conclusion that a definite
number of venial sins might eventually grow into a mortal
sin, or that repeated venial sins gradually diminish grace
until finally it disappears. The first-mentioned assumption
is impossible because venial differs generically from
mortal sin, and a transition from the one to the other
would be a μετάβασις εἰς ἄλλο γένος. The second assumption
would entail the heretical inference that the state of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grace can be lost without mortal sin.<a id="noteref_1189" name="noteref_1189" href="#note_1189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1189</span></span></a> No doubt venial
sin influences the state of grace unfavorably; but this evil
influence must be conceived as indirect—by committing
venial sins man weakens his will-power, and temptation
eventually grows so strong as to make mortal sin inevitable.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
β) If we inquire how sanctifying grace increases
in the soul, we find that the process must
be conceived as a growing intensity analogous to
that of light and heat in the physical order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Gratia prima</span></span>, as
we have seen in a previous chapter, is
a supernatural physical quality.<a id="noteref_1191" name="noteref_1191" href="#note_1191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1191</span></span></a> Hence its increase,

must be an increase of physical quality.

In what does this process consist? Certain Thomists<a id="noteref_1193" name="noteref_1193" href="#note_1193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1193</span></span></a>
describe it as a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">maior
radicatio in subiecto</span></span>, while
the majority of theologians hold that it is simply an
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">additio gradus ad
gradum</span></span>. This latter explanation is
probably the correct one. Sanctifying grace is either
capable of gradual increase, or it is not. If it is, there is
no reason why God should deny such an increase under
certain conditions. If it is not, Luther would have been
right in contending that a newly baptized infant enjoys
the same measure of holiness as the Blessed Virgin Mary
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or the human soul of our Divine Lord. It is impossible
to imagine how grace could produce a quantitatively
higher holiness by simply striking its roots deeper into
the soul.<a id="noteref_1194" name="noteref_1194" href="#note_1194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1194</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
γ) A question of greater practical importance
is this: Is the increase of sanctifying grace accompanied
by a corresponding increase of the infused
virtues, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every increase or decrease of sanctifying grace must
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">eo ipso</span></span>
entail a corresponding increase or decrease, respectively,
of theological charity. Charity is either
identical with grace or it is not.<a id="noteref_1195" name="noteref_1195" href="#note_1195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1195</span></span></a> If it is, an increase of
the one implies an increase of the other; if it is not, the
one cannot increase without an increase of the other, because
they are inseparable and related to each other as
nature to faculty, or root to blossom. Moreover, the
degree of heavenly glory enjoyed by a soul will be commensurate
with the measure of charity which it possessed
at death. Now grace and glory bear a proportional
relation to each other. Consequently, grace is augmented
as charity increases, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>. The same
argument applies to the infused moral virtues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The case is different, however, with the theological
virtues of faith and hope. These may continue to exist
in the soul after charity has departed, and hence are not
inseparable from sanctifying grace and charity, nor from
the moral virtues. This consideration led Suarez to infer
that, as the theological virtues of faith and hope may be
infused into the soul independently of charity and before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
justification, they must be susceptible of increase in the
course of justification without regard to the existing state
of grace and charity.<a id="noteref_1196" name="noteref_1196" href="#note_1196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1196</span></span></a> This is true of the sinner. In
the justified, as Suarez himself admits, an increase of
grace (or charity) probably always entails an increase of
faith and hope,<a id="noteref_1197" name="noteref_1197" href="#note_1197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1197</span></span></a>—a proposition which finds strong support
in the decree of Trent which says: <span class="tei tei-q">“This increase
of justification Holy Church begs, when she prays:
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Give unto us, O Lord, increase of faith, hope, and
charity.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_1198" name="noteref_1198" href="#note_1198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1198</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
δ) A final question forces itself upon the enquiring
mind, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: Is sanctifying grace capable
of an indefinite increase, or is there a limit beyond
which it cannot grow? In trying to find an
answer to this question we must draw a careful
distinction between the absolute and the ordinary
power of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no intrinsic contradiction in the assumption
that grace can be indefinitely augmented. True, it can
never become actually infinite, as this would involve an

Proof. Calvin asserted that neither justification
nor faith can be lost by those who are predestined
to salvation, and that the unpredestined
are never truly justified. Luther held that justifying
grace is lost solely through the sin of infidelity.
Against the former the Council of Trent
declared: <span class="tei tei-q">“If anyone saith that a man once justified
can sin no more, nor lose grace, and that
therefore he that falls and sins was never truly
justified; ... let him be anathema.”</span><a id="noteref_1203" name="noteref_1203" href="#note_1203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1203</span></span></a> Against
the latter the same council defined: <span class="tei tei-q">“If anyone
saith that there is no mortal sin but that of infidelity,
or that grace once received is not lost by any
other sin, however grievous and enormous, save
by that of infidelity, let him be anathema.”</span><a id="noteref_1204" name="noteref_1204" href="#note_1204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1204</span></span></a> At

declared that venial sin does not destroy the state
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of grace: <span class="tei tei-q">“For although during this mortal life,
men, how holy and just soever, at times fall into at
least light and daily sins, which are also called
venial, they do not therefore cease to be just.”</span><a id="noteref_1205" name="noteref_1205" href="#note_1205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1205</span></span></a>

a) This teaching is so obviously in accord with
Sacred Scripture that we confine ourselves to
quoting three or four passages. Ezechiel says
that sanctifying grace may be irretrievably lost:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If the just man turn himself away from his justice,
and do iniquity according to all the abominations
which the wicked man useth to work, shall
he live? All his justices which he hath done shall
not be remembered; in the prevarication, by which
he hath prevaricated, and in his sin, which he
hath committed, in them he shall die.”</span><a id="noteref_1206" name="noteref_1206" href="#note_1206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1206</span></span></a> Our

St. Paul not only warns the faithful in general
terms: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that thinketh himself to stand, let
him take heed lest he fall;”</span><a id="noteref_1208" name="noteref_1208" href="#note_1208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1208</span></span></a> but expressly designates
certain mortal sins as a bar to Heaven:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,

b) The teaching of Tradition was brought out
clearly in the fight against Jovinian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That wily heretic claimed the authority of St. John for
the assertion that the grace of Baptism can never be lost.
The Johannean passage in question reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever
is born of God, committeth no sin: for His seed abideth
in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.”</span><a id="noteref_1210" name="noteref_1210" href="#note_1210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1210</span></span></a>
St. Jerome in his reply paraphrases the passage as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore I tell you, my little children, whosoever is
born of God, committeth no sin, in order that you may
not sin and that you may know that you will remain sons of God so long

he cannot say: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have not received,’</span> because of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“As he who falls away from the faith is an apostate, so
he who returns to an evil deed is regarded by Almighty
God as an apostate, even though he may seem to retain
the faith; for the one without the other can be of no use,
because faith availeth nought without [good] works,

of Penance would be useless.<a id="noteref_1214" name="noteref_1214" href="#note_1214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1214</span></span></a>

c) In connection with this subject theologians
are wont to discuss the question whether or not
the forfeiture of sanctifying grace involves the
loss of its supernatural concomitants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theological love or charity is substantially identical
with sanctifying grace, or at least inseparable from it,
and hence both are gained and lost together. This is
an article of faith. To lose sanctifying grace, therefore,
is to lose theological love. On the other hand, it is
equally <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de fide</span></span>
that theological faith (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">habitus fidei</span></span>) is not
destroyed by mortal sin;<a id="noteref_1215" name="noteref_1215" href="#note_1215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1215</span></span></a> it can be lost only by the sin of
unbelief.<a id="noteref_1216" name="noteref_1216" href="#note_1216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1216</span></span></a> The same is true,
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatis mutandis</span></span>, of theological
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hope. True, the Church has not definitely declared
her mind with regard to hope, but it may be set
down as her teaching that hope is not lost with grace and
charity but survives like faith.<a id="noteref_1217" name="noteref_1217" href="#note_1217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1217</span></span></a> The two contrary opposites
of hope are desperation and presumption, concerning
which theologians commonly hold that the
former destroys hope, while the latter probably does not.
But even if hope and charity are lost, faith may remain
in the soul like a solitary root, from which, under more
favorable conditions, new life is apt to spring. As regards
the infused moral virtues and the seven gifts of
the Holy Ghost (and, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
fortiori</span></span>, His personal indwelling
in the soul),<a id="noteref_1218" name="noteref_1218" href="#note_1218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1218</span></span></a>
it is the unanimous teaching that these
disappear with sanctifying grace and charity, even
though faith and hope survive. The reason is that
these virtues and gifts are merely supernatural adjuncts
of sanctifying grace and cannot persist without it. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Accessorium

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Merit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum</span></span>), as we have explained in the
first part of this treatise,<a id="noteref_1221" name="noteref_1221" href="#note_1221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1221</span></span></a> is that property of a
good work which entitles the doer to a reward

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethics and theology distinguish two kinds of
merit: (1) condign merit or merit in the strict
sense of the term (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum adaequatum sive de

(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum inadaequatum sive de congruo</span></span>).
Condign merit supposes an equality between service
and return. It is measured by commutative
justice and confers a strict claim to a reward.
Congruous merit, owing to its inadequacy and the
lack of strict proportion between service and
recompense, confers no such claim except on
grounds of equity.<a id="noteref_1222" name="noteref_1222" href="#note_1222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1222</span></span></a>

helps to execute the divine plan of governance in regard

It is objected against this argument that our supernatural
merits, being finite, are in no proportion to the possession
and enjoyment of an Infinite Good. This objection
vanishes in the light of the following considerations:
(1) Sanctifying grace is a kind of
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">deificatio</span></span>, which
raises man above himself to a quasi-divine dignity that
colors all his actions.<a id="noteref_1254" name="noteref_1254" href="#note_1254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1254</span></span></a> (2) The ability of the justified to

One difficulty still remains, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: By what title do infants

We answer: The just man has two distinct claims to

a richer reward. Both claims ultimately rest on the merits

Would it not be far more derogatory to the honor of our
Saviour to assume that He failed to obtain for those for
whom He suffered and died, a limited capacity for gaining
merits? Does it in any way impair the dignity of God
as the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">causa prima</span></span>
to assume that He communicates to
His creatures a limited causality, by which they are enabled

<span class="tei tei-q">“self-righteousness”</span> because he regards his good works

as <span class="tei tei-q">“fruits of justification,”</span> owing purely to grace. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“self-righteousness”</span> of which Luther speaks is incompatible
with the virtue of humility. The faithful Christian,
according to St. Paul, may safely rejoice over his
merits, because the uncertainty of justification and the
consciousness that his good works are but limited at best,
are a sufficient protection against self-righteousness and
presumption.<a id="noteref_1260" name="noteref_1260" href="#note_1260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1260</span></span></a>

b) We need not enter into these controversies to
understand that condign merit supposes an equality between

from Sacred Scripture by an indirect argument. The
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum de

If I do a good deed which I am free to do or
not to do, I perform a morally good and therefore
meritorious work. As regards the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">libertas specificationis</span></span>,
(that freedom by which a person may
act thus or otherwise, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> give alms to one
applicant in preference to another, or mortify
himself in this or that particular manner), there
can be no doubt that, whatever the choice made,
the action is always good and meritorious. However,
theologians have excogitated a hypothetical
case in which an action may be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physically</span></em> free
without being meritorious. It is when one is
compelled to do a certain thing and is free only
in so far as he is able to choose between two actions
exactly equal in moral worth. This would
be the case, for instance, if he had to pay a debt
of ten dollars and were left free to pay it either in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
coin or in currency. The more common opinion
is that in a case of this kind there would be a lack
of that liberty which is necessary to render an act
morally good and therefore meritorious.<a id="noteref_1284" name="noteref_1284" href="#note_1284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1284</span></span></a>

c) The third requisite of merit is actual grace.
Its necessity is evident from the fact that, to be
meritorious, an act must be supernatural and consequently
cannot be performed without the aid of
prevenient and coöperating grace.<a id="noteref_1285" name="noteref_1285" href="#note_1285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1285</span></span></a>

for the reason that every good work must be

the end for which it is performed

α) A considerable number, mostly of the Thomist persuasion,
demand the motive of theological charity, and
consequently regard the state of charity
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">caritas habitualis
sive status caritatis et gratiae</span></span>) as essential for the
meritoriousness of all good works performed in the state
of grace, even if they are performed from some other,
truly supernatural though inferior motive, such as
obedience, the fear of God, etc. This rigorous school
is constrained to raise the question whether every single
good work, to be supernaturally meritorious, must
proceed from an act of divine charity
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">toties quoties</span></span>), or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

a series of subsequent acts with meritoriousness.
Only a few Thomist theologians<a id="noteref_1286" name="noteref_1286" href="#note_1286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1286</span></span></a> defend the first-mentioned

hold that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">influxus
virtualis caritatis</span></span> is sufficient. This view is vigorously
defended by Cardinal Bellarmine, who says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not
enough to make a general good intention at the beginning
of a year, or month, or day, by which all future actions
are referred to God; but it is necessary to refer each

The dogmatic question whether good works can be
meritorious without being inspired by supernatural charity,
has nothing to do with the moral problem whether
there is an obligation to make an act of charity from time
to time, except in so far as habitual charity,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
state of charity, which is always required for merit, nay
even for the preservation of sanctifying grace,—cannot
be permanently sustained unless renewed from time to

act of charity at least once a month, but he is contradicted
by other eminent moralists. In practice it is well
to insist on frequent acts of charity because such acts not

our good works incomparably more meritorious in the

β) There is a second group of very eminent theologians,
including Suarez,<a id="noteref_1292" name="noteref_1292" href="#note_1292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1292</span></span></a>

who hold that, to be meritorious, the good works of
a just man, who has habitual charity, need only conform
to the divine law, no special motive being required.
These writers base their teaching on the Tridentine
decree which says: <span class="tei tei-q">“For this is that crown
of justice which the Apostle declared was, after his
fight and course, laid up for him, to be rendered to
him by the Just Judge, and not only to him, but also to
all that love His coming. For, whereas Jesus Christ
Himself continually infuses His virtue into the said
justified,—as the head into the members and the vine
into the branches,—and this virtue always precedes, and
accompanies, and follows their good works, which without
it could not in any wise be pleasing and meritorious
before God (can. 2), we must believe that nothing further
is wanting to the justified to prevent their being accounted
to have, by those very works which have been done in
God, fully satisfied the divine law according to the
state of this life, and to have truly merited eternal life,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to be obtained also in its [due] time, if so be, however,
that they depart in grace.”</span><a id="noteref_1294" name="noteref_1294" href="#note_1294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1294</span></span></a> This teaching is in harmony
with Scripture. The Bible nowhere requires an act of
charity to make good works meritorious for Heaven. In
the <span class="tei tei-q">“eight beatitudes”</span><a id="noteref_1295" name="noteref_1295" href="#note_1295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1295</span></span></a> our Lord Himself promises
eternal glory for works which are not all works of charity,
nor even dictated by charity, either formal or virtual.
When He was asked: <span class="tei tei-q">“Master, what good shall I do
that I may have life everlasting?”</span><a id="noteref_1296" name="noteref_1296" href="#note_1296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1296</span></span></a> he did not answer
with Bellarmine: <span class="tei tei-q">“Steep all thy works in the motive of
charity,”</span> but declared: <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou wilt enter into life, keep
the commandments.”</span><a id="noteref_1297" name="noteref_1297" href="#note_1297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1297</span></span></a> And when requested to specify,
He simply cited the ordinary precepts of the Decalogue.<a id="noteref_1298" name="noteref_1298" href="#note_1298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1298</span></span></a>
We also know that at the Last Judgment He
will receive the elect into the <span class="tei tei-q">“kingdom of His Father”</span>
solely in consideration of the works of mercy they have
done.<a id="noteref_1299" name="noteref_1299" href="#note_1299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1299</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Theological reasoning lends its support to this view. If
good works performed without the motive of charity
were not supernaturally meritorious, this would be attributable
to one of three causes. Either the just would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sin by doing good; or good works performed without
charity would not be deserving of eternal beatitude; or,
finally, there would be no strict equality between service
and reward. All three of these suppositions are untenable.
The first would lead to Bajanism or Jansenism.<a id="noteref_1300" name="noteref_1300" href="#note_1300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1300</span></span></a>
The second and third overlook the fact that the
requisite proportion (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">condignitas</span></span>)
between service and
reward is furnished by sanctifying grace or habitual charity,
which, as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">deificatio</span></span>,
adoptive sonship, and union with
the Holy Ghost, actually supplies that for which the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">motivum caritatis</span></span> is demanded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We might ask the advocates of the more rigorous opinion,
whence the act of charity which they demand for
every meritorious work, derives its peculiar proportionality
or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">condignitas</span></span>
with the beatific vision. Surely not
from itself, because as an act it is merely <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">primus inter
pares</span></span>, without in any essential respect excelling other
motives. There is no alternative but to attribute it to
that quasi-divine dignity which is imparted to the just
man and his works by sanctifying grace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For these reasons present-day theology regards the
second theory as sufficiently well established and the faithful
are largely guided by it in practice.<a id="noteref_1301" name="noteref_1301" href="#note_1301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1301</span></span></a>

Does the degree of sanctifying grace existing in the
soul exert a decisive influence on the amount of merit
due to the good works performed? This question can
be easily solved on the theological principle that the supernatural
dignity of the soul increases in proportion to its
growth in sanctifying grace. Vasquez holds that, other
things being equal, one who is holier gains no greater
merit by performing a given work than one who is less
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

that the meritoriousness of a good deed is larger in proportion
to the godlike dignity of the agent, which in turn
is measured by the degree of sanctifying grace in the soul.
This explains why God, in consideration of the greater
holiness of some saints who are especially dear to Him,
often deigns through their intercession to grant favors
which He refuses to others.<a id="noteref_1309" name="noteref_1309" href="#note_1309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1309</span></span></a>

good works may become meritorious. This rather

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After defining the existence of merit the Tridentine
Council enumerates its objects as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If anyone saith that the justified, by the
good works which he performs, ... does not
truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the
attainment of that eternal life,—if it be so, however,
that he depart in grace,—and also an increase
of glory: let him be anathema.”</span><a id="noteref_1320" name="noteref_1320" href="#note_1320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1320</span></span></a> Hence
merit calls for a threefold reward: (1) an increase
of sanctifying grace; (2) heavenly glory;
and (3) an increase of that glory. The expression
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vere mereri</span></span>”</span>
shows that all three of these
objects can be merited in the true and strict sense
of the term (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de
condigno</span></span>). This is, however, no
more than a theologically certain conclusion.

above-quoted conciliar definition is that it can be
increased by good works. This increase is technically
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia secunda</span></span>. All Scriptural
texts which assert that sanctifying grace is unequal
in different individuals, also prove that it
can be increased or augmented by the performance
of meritorious works.<a id="noteref_1322" name="noteref_1322" href="#note_1322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1322</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) No adult person can merit the first grace of assistance
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia prima
actualis</span></span>), nor any one of the series
of actual graces which follow it, and by which justification
ultimately comes to pass. They are all purely gratuitous.
Similarly, too, the first grace of justification (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
prima habitualis</span></span>) cannot be strictly merited by the sinner
preparing for justification. This is the express teaching
of Trent: <span class="tei tei-q">“But we are therefore said to be justified
freely, because that none of those things which precede
justification—whether faith or works—merit the grace
itself of justification; for, if it be a grace, it is not now
by works; otherwise, as the same Apostle says, grace
is no more grace.”</span><a id="noteref_1323" name="noteref_1323" href="#note_1323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1323</span></span></a> To deny this would not only
imperil the dogma of the gratuity of grace (because if
the first grace given before active justification could be
strictly merited, this would necessarily involve
the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
prima actualis</span></span>), but it would also start a vicious circle
(because the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
prima habitualis</span></span> is an indispensable
condition of merit). This explains why St. Paul and St.
Augustine again and again insist on the gratuity both of
the first grace of assistance and the grace of justification
proper.<a id="noteref_1324" name="noteref_1324" href="#note_1324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1324</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“This grace of Christ,”</span> says St. Augustine,
<span class="tei tei-q">“without which neither infants nor adults can be saved,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is not bestowed for any merits, but is given freely, on
account of which it is also called grace. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Being justified,’</span> says the Apostle,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the light of this teaching it is easy to decide the
question, raised by Vasquez, whether perfect contrition
justifies the sinner merely <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per
modum dispositionis</span></span> or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per
modum causae formalis</span></span>. Both contrition and charity, be
they perfect or imperfect, are essentially acts that dispose
the soul for justification.<a id="noteref_1326" name="noteref_1326" href="#note_1326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1326</span></span></a> Hence, no matter how perfect,
neither is capable of effecting justification itself by way of
merit (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">merendo</span></span>),
nay, of entering even partially, as
Vasquez would have it, into the formal cause of justification,
because, according to the Tridentine Council, sanctifying
grace and not perfect contrition is the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">unica causa
formalis</span></span> of justification.<a id="noteref_1327" name="noteref_1327" href="#note_1327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1327</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) In connection with the dogma just explained theologians
discuss the question whether a just man may
strictly (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de
condigno</span></span>) merit the actual graces which
God bestows on him. We must carefully distinguish
between merely sufficient and efficacious graces. Theologians
commonly hold<a id="noteref_1328" name="noteref_1328" href="#note_1328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1328</span></span></a> that merely sufficient graces
may be merited <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de
condigno</span></span>, not so efficacious graces,
because the right to efficacious graces would necessarily
include a strict right to final perseverance
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">donum perseverantiae</span></span>),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which lies outside the sphere of condign
merit. Assuming that the justified could by good works
strictly merit the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">prima
gratia efficax</span></span> (an impossible hypothesis,
because merit presupposes efficacious grace),
this would involve a similar claim to a second, third,
fourth grace—and ultimately to the final grace of perseverance,
which, in matter of fact, no man can merit. Not
even heroic acts of virtue give a strict right to infallibly
efficacious graces, or to final perseverance. Even the
greatest saint is obliged to watch, pray, and tremble, lest
he lapse from righteousness.<a id="noteref_1329" name="noteref_1329" href="#note_1329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1329</span></span></a> For this reason the Tridentine
Council mentions neither final perseverance nor
efficacious graces among the objects of merit.<a id="noteref_1330" name="noteref_1330" href="#note_1330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1330</span></span></a>

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eternal Life or Heavenly Glory.</span></span>—The
second object of merit is eternal life. The
dogmatic proof for this assertion has been given
above.<a id="noteref_1331" name="noteref_1331" href="#note_1331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1331</span></span></a>
Eternal life is described by the Tridentine
Council<a id="noteref_1332" name="noteref_1332" href="#note_1332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1332</span></span></a> both as a grace and as a reward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
a) In the canon quoted in the introduction of this Section
the same Council<a id="noteref_1333" name="noteref_1333" href="#note_1333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1333</span></span></a>
enumerates four apparently separate
and distinct objects of merit, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: increase of
grace, eternal life, the attainment of eternal life, and increase
of glory. Why the distinction between <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal
life”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“attainment of eternal life”</span>? Does this
imply a twofold reward, and consequently a twofold
object of merit? Theologians deny that such was the
intention of the Council, because the right to a reward
evidently coincides with the right to the payment of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
same. An unattainable eternal life would be a
chimera.<a id="noteref_1334" name="noteref_1334" href="#note_1334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1334</span></span></a>
Nevertheless, the distinction is not superfluous,
since the attainment of eternal life does not coincide
with the gaining of merit but must be put off until
death, and even then depends upon the condition of the
soul: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">si
tamen in gratia decesserit</span></span>”</span> (provided he depart
in grace). With this last condition the holy Synod also
wished to inculcate the salutary truth that the loss of
sanctifying grace <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ipso
facto</span></span> entails the forfeiture of all
previously acquired merits. Even the greatest saint, were
he to die in the state of mortal sin, would enter eternity
with empty hands and as an enemy of God. All his
former merits would be cancelled. To revive them would
require a new justification.<a id="noteref_1335" name="noteref_1335" href="#note_1335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1335</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
b) A close analysis of the Tridentine canon under review
gives rise to another difficulty. Can the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria prima</span></span>
be merited? In defining the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
secunda</span></span> as an object
of strict merit, the Council expressly excludes the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia prima</span></span>.
It makes no such distinction in regard to
glory, but names both <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal life”</span>
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria prima</span></span>) and
<span class="tei tei-q">“increase of glory”</span> (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria
secunda</span></span>) as objects of merit.
This naturally suggests the query: Why and to what
extent can the just man merit the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria prima</span></span>, seeing that
he is unable to merit the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
prima</span></span>? Some theologians<a id="noteref_1336" name="noteref_1336" href="#note_1336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1336</span></span></a>
contend that the justified are entitled to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria
prima</span></span> only as a heritage
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">titulo haereditatis</span></span>), never as
a reward (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">titulo mercedis</span></span>).
Because of its intimate causal connection with the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia prima</span></span>, which is beyond
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the reach of merit, the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria prima</span></span>, they argue, cannot be
regarded as an object of merit except on the assumption
that the merits which precede justification confer a claim
to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria
prima</span></span>. This assumption is false, because
without sanctifying grace no condign merits can be
acquired.<a id="noteref_1337" name="noteref_1337" href="#note_1337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1337</span></span></a>
In spite of this difficulty, however, most theologians<a id="noteref_1338" name="noteref_1338" href="#note_1338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1338</span></span></a>
hold that, unlike the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
prima</span></span>, the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria
prima</span></span> may under certain conditions be an object of strict
merit. The main reason is that, as the state of glory is
not a necessary requisite of the meritoriousness of good
works, while the state of grace is, the former
may <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">positis
ponendis</span></span> be an effect of the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum de congruo</span></span>, though
the latter may not. A mere statement of the problem
shows that it cannot be satisfactorily solved unless we distinguish
between and enter into a detailed examination of
two distinct hypotheses. It is generally agreed that infants
dying in the state of baptismal grace owe that grace,
and the state of glory which they enjoy in Heaven,
solely to God's mercy and have no claim to beatitude
other than that of heredity
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">titulus hereditatis</span></span>). Adults
who preserve their baptismal innocence until death,
manifestly cannot merit the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria prima</span></span> by their good
works, because they already possess a legal title to it
through Baptism.<a id="noteref_1339" name="noteref_1339" href="#note_1339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1339</span></span></a> It follows that their good works
increase, but do not merit, the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria prima</span></span>, to which these
souls are already entitled
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">titulo haereditatis</span></span>. The case is
quite different with catechumens and Christians guilty of
mortal sin, who are justified by an act of perfect contrition
before the reception of Baptism or the Sacrament of Penance.
Of them it may be said, without fear of contradiction,
that they merit for themselves <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de condigno</span></span>, not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indeed the first grace of justification, but the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gloria
prima</span></span>, because perfect contrition, being
an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">opus operans</span></span>,
at the very moment of its infusion becomes an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">opus
meritorium</span></span> entitled to eternal glory.<a id="noteref_1340" name="noteref_1340" href="#note_1340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1340</span></span></a> As regards the
great majority of adult Catholics who, because of defective
preparation, never get beyond imperfect contrition
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">attritio</span></span>),
and therefore are not justified until they actually
receive the Sacrament, it is certain that they owe
whatever grace they possess and whatever glory they have
a claim to, entirely to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">opus
operatum</span></span> of the Sacrament.<a id="noteref_1341" name="noteref_1341" href="#note_1341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1341</span></span></a>

correspond to an increase of grace, which in its

good works. That there is a causal connection
between meritorious works performed

Hence congruous merit and condign merit are not
species of the same genus, but merely analogous terms.
Because of the ambiguity of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“equity”</span> Dominicus

the use of the term <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum

this was a mistake. The Fathers engaged in the Semipelagian

assert that the justifying faith of the sinner is entirely
without merit. The requisites of congruous merit are

he [God] will forgive thy offences.”</span><a id="noteref_1351" name="noteref_1351" href="#note_1351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1351</span></span></a> St. Augustine
says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The remission of sins itself is not without some
merit, if faith asks for it. Nor is that faith entirely
unmeritorious by which the publican was moved to say:
<span class="tei tei-q">‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner,’</span> and then went away justified through the
merit of faithful humility.”</span><a id="noteref_1352" name="noteref_1352" href="#note_1352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1352</span></span></a>

b) By good works the just may merit for themselves,
not in strict justice (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de condigno</span></span>), but as
a matter of equity (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de

conversion from mortal sin, spiritual favors

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
α) It is a theologically certain conclusion, accepted by
all theologians without exception, that the grace of final
perseverance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">donum
perseverantiae</span></span>) cannot be merited
in the strict sense (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de
condigno</span></span>). Most authors hold,
however, that it can be merited de congruo.
This <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum</span></span>
is technically called <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">meritum
de congruo fallibili</span></span>. Those
who deny that it can be merited at all, admit that it can be infallibly obtained
by fervent and unremitting prayer.<a id="noteref_1353" name="noteref_1353" href="#note_1353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1353</span></span></a>

β) It is impossible to answer with anything like certainty
the question whether the just man is able to merit
for himself in advance the grace of conversion against
the eventuality of a future lapse into mortal sin. Following
the lead of Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas takes a
negative view,<a id="noteref_1354" name="noteref_1354" href="#note_1354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1354</span></span></a>
on the ground that mortal sin interrupts
the state of grace and annihilates all former merits. In
another passage of his writings, however, the Angelic
Doctor says: <span class="tei tei-q">“There are two kinds of merit, one based
on justice, and this is called condign; and another based
solely upon mercy, and this is called congruous. Of the
latter St. Paul says that it is just, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> congruous, that a
man who has performed many good works should merit.... And
in this wise God does not forget our work and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
love.”</span><a id="noteref_1355" name="noteref_1355" href="#note_1355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1355</span></span></a> Scotus,<a id="noteref_1356" name="noteref_1356" href="#note_1356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1356</span></span></a> Bonaventure,<a id="noteref_1357" name="noteref_1357" href="#note_1357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1357</span></span></a> and Suarez<a id="noteref_1358" name="noteref_1358" href="#note_1358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1358</span></span></a> regard
this as <span class="tei tei-q">“a pious and probable opinion,”</span> well supported
by Holy Scripture. The prophet Jehu said to Josaphat,
King of Juda: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou helpest the ungodly, and thou art
joined in friendship with them that hate the Lord, and
therefore thou didst deserve indeed the wrath of the
Lord; but good works are found in thee.”</span><a id="noteref_1359" name="noteref_1359" href="#note_1359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1359</span></span></a> To this
argument add the following consideration: If previous
mortal sin does not prevent those acts whereby man is
disposed for justification from being at least to a limited
extent meritorious, there is no reason to assume that
merits cancelled by subsequent mortal sin will not be imputed
to the sinner, with due regard, of course, to a certain
proportion between past merits and future sins.<a id="noteref_1360" name="noteref_1360" href="#note_1360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1360</span></span></a>
To pray for the grace of conversion against the eventuality
of future mortal sin, is always good and useful,<a id="noteref_1361" name="noteref_1361" href="#note_1361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a>
because it cannot but please God to know that we sincerely
desire to be restored to His friendship if we should
ever have the misfortune of losing it.<a id="noteref_1362" name="noteref_1362" href="#note_1362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1362</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
γ) The just man may congruously merit for others
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whatever he is able to merit for himself, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the grace
of conversion, final perseverance, and also the first
prevenient grace (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">gratia
prima praeveniens</span></span>), which no man in the state of
original sin is able to merit for himself.<a id="noteref_1363" name="noteref_1363" href="#note_1363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1363</span></span></a>
The reason for this, according to St. Thomas,
is the intimate relation of friendship which sanctifying
grace establishes between the just man and God.<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364" href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a> However,
as Sylvius rightly observes, it is not in the power
of the just to obtain by this friendship favors which would
involve the abrogation of the divinely established order of
salvation. Such a favor would be, for example, the justification
of a sinner without the medium of grace, or
of a child without the agency of Baptism. An unreasonable
petition deserves no consideration, even if made by a
friend. What may be obtained by the merit of good
works may be even more effectively obtained by prayer
for others. The Apostle St. James teaches: <span class="tei tei-q">“Pray for
one another that you may be saved; for the continual
prayer of a just man availeth much.”</span><a id="noteref_1365" name="noteref_1365" href="#note_1365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1365</span></span></a> This consoling
truth is confirmed by the dogma of the Communion of Saints, by
many illustrious examples from the Bible<a id="noteref_1366" name="noteref_1366" href="#note_1366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1366</span></span></a>
and ecclesiastical history,<a id="noteref_1367" name="noteref_1367" href="#note_1367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1367</span></span></a> and by the traditional practice
of the Church in praying God to give strength and perseverance
to the faithful and the grace of conversion to
the heathen and the sinner.<a id="noteref_1368" name="noteref_1368" href="#note_1368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1368</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
δ) A final question remains to be answered: Can the
just congruously merit such temporal blessings as good
health, a comfortable living, and success in business?
They can, but only in so far as these favors are conducive
to eternal salvation; for otherwise they would not be
graces. St. Thomas seems to go even further than this
by describing temporal favors as objects of condign
merit when they are conducive to salvation, and of congruous
merit when they bear no relation to that end.<a id="noteref_1369" name="noteref_1369" href="#note_1369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1369</span></span></a>
We have no space left to enter into an argument on this
point, but in conclusion wish to call attention to two important
facts: first, that prayer is more effective than good
works in obtaining temporal as well as spiritual favors;
and secondly, that we should not strive with too much
anxiety for earthly goods, but direct our thoughts, desires,
prayers, and actions to God, the Infinite Good, who
has promised to be our <span class="tei tei-q">“exceeding great reward.”</span><a id="noteref_1370" name="noteref_1370" href="#note_1370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1370</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Prima opinio eorum est, qui gratiam

Bellarmine treats this opinion
as the extreme counterpart of
Thomism (which he also combats)
and disposes of it thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Haec

b. Augustini et, quantum ego existimo,
a sententia etiam Scripturarum

Scriptural texts which he quotes in
support of this view are John VI, 45,
1 Cor. IV, 7, Rom. IX, 11.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_766" name="note_766" href="#noteref_766">766.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">The learned Cardinal describes
the difference between
Congruism and extreme Molinism
(which latter, it may be remarked,
was not defended by Molina
himself) as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Neque
enim intelligi potest, quo pacto gratia
efficax consistat in illa interna suasione,
quae per liberum arbitrium
respui potest, et tamen infallibilem
effectum habeat, nisi addamus, Deum
iis quos efficaciter et infallibiliter
trahere decrevit, eam suasionem adhibere
quam videt congruere ingenio
eorum et quam certo novit ab eis non
contemnendam.</span></span>”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Op. cit.</span></span>, p. 531.)
The objection that this explanation
eventually resolves itself into the
Molinistic theory which he had censured,
Bellarmine meets as follows:
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Respondeo sententiam nostram,
quam S. Augustini esse demonstravimus,
aliqua in re cum prima illa
opinione convenire, sed in multis ab
illa discrepare. Convenit enim in eo
quod utraque sententia gratiam sufficentem
et efficacem ponit in auxilio
excitante potissimum, non in adiuvante.
Sed discrepant inter se, quod
prima opinio vult efficaciam gratiae
pendere a voluntate humana, nostra
